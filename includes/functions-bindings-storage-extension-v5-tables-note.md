> [!NOTE]
> [Version 5.x of the Storage extension NuGet package][extension-5.x] and [version 3.x of the extension bundle][bundle-3.x] currently do not include the [Table Storage bindings][tables]. If your app requires Table Storage, you will need to continue using [version 4.x of the extension NuGet package][extension-4.x] or [version 2.x of the extension bundle][bundle-2.x] for now.
