# Use Azure Blob storage to manage commercial marketplace leads

The commercial marketplace support for Azure Blob storage has been deprecated and is no longer an option to process leads from your offer. If you currently have a commercial marketplace offer with lead management configured for Azure Blob, you will no longer receive customer leads. If that is the case, we recommend that you connect your offer to one of the other Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems supported by the commercial marketplace.

## Connect to your CRM system

[!INCLUDE [Connect lead management](../includes/customer-leads.md)]

## Next steps

To learn how lead management works in the commercial marketplace, see [Customer leads from your commercial marketplace offer](../partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md).
