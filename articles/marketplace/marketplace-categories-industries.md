Select categories and subcategories that best align with the value proposition of your listing. You can select:

- A maximum of two categories, including a primary and a secondary (optional) category.
- A maximum of two subcategories for each primary and/or secondary category. If no subcategory is selected, you offer will be discoverable in the selected category only. Select a subcategory to make your offer discoverable within a smaller subset.
