# Support and help options for Azure Active Directory

If you need an answer to a question or help in solving a problem not covered in our documentation, it might be time to reach out to experts for help. Here are several suggestions for getting answers to your questions as you use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

## Create an Azure support request

</div>

Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits, whether you're an IT admin managing your organization's tenant, a developer just starting your cloud journey, or a large organization deploying business-critical, strategic applications. Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal.

- If you already have an Azure Support Plan, [open a support request here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

- If you're not an Azure customer, you can open a support request with [Microsoft Support for business](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness).

## Post a question to Microsoft Q&A
