# How to use Microsoft managed settings - Authentication Methods Policy

<!---what API--->

In addition to configuring Authentication Methods Policy settings to be either **Enabled** or **Disabled**, IT admins can configure some settings to be **Microsoft managed**. A setting that is configured as **Microsoft managed** allows Azure AD to enable or disable the setting. 

The option to let Azure AD manage the setting is a convenient way for an organization to allow Microsoft to enable or disable a feature by default. Organizations can more easily improve their security posture by trusting Microsoft to manage when a feature should be enabled by default. By configuring a setting as **Microsoft managed** (named *default* in Graph APIs), IT admins can trust Microsoft to enable a security feature they have not explicitly disabled. 

## Settings that can be Microsoft managed

The following table lists settings that can be set to Microsoft managed and whether it is enabled or disabled.
