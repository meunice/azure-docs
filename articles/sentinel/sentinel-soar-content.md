# Microsoft Sentinel SOAR content catalog

Microsoft Sentinel provides a wide variety of playbooks and connectors for security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), so that you can readily integrate Microsoft Sentinel with any product or service in your environment.

The integrations listed below may include some or all of the following components:

| Component type | Purpose | Use case and linked instructions |
| -------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Playbook templates** | Automated workflow | Use playbook templates to deploy ready-made playbooks for responding to threats automatically.<br><br>[Automate threat response with playbooks in Microsoft Sentinel](automate-responses-with-playbooks.md) |
| **Azure Logic Apps managed connector** | Building blocks for creating playbooks | Playbooks use managed connectors to communicate with hundreds of both Microsoft and non-Microsoft services.<br><br>[List of Logic Apps connectors and their documentation](/connectors/connector-reference/) |
| **Azure Logic Apps custom connector** | Building blocks for creating playbooks | You may want to communicate with services that aren't available as prebuilt connectors. Custom connectors address this need by allowing you to create (and even share) a connector and define its own triggers and actions.<br><ul><li>[Custom connectors overview](/connectors/custom-connectors/)<li>[Create your own custom Logic Apps connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors/create-logic-apps-connector) |
|

You can find SOAR integrations and their components in the following places:

- Microsoft Sentinel solutions
- Microsoft Sentinel Automation blade, playbook templates tab
- Logic Apps designer (for managed Logic Apps connectors)
- Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository

> [!TIP]
> - Many SOAR integrations can be deployed as part of a [Microsoft Sentinel solution](sentinel-solutions.md), together with related data connectors, analytics rules and workbooks. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel solutions catalog](sentinel-solutions-catalog.md).
> - More integrations are provided by the Microsoft Sentinel community and can be found in the GitHub repository.
> - If you have a product or service that isn't listed or currently supported, please submit a Feature Request.  
> You can also create your own, using the following tools:
>    - Logic Apps custom connector
>    - Azure functions
>    - Logic Apps HTTP calls
