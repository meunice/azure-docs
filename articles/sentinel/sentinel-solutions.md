# About Microsoft Sentinel content and solutions

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Microsoft Sentinel **Content hub** and solutions are currently in **PREVIEW**, as are all individual solution packages. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Microsoft Sentinel *content* is Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) content that enables customers to ingest data, monitor, alert, hunt, investigate, respond, and connect with different products, platforms, and services in Microsoft Sentinel.

Content in Microsoft Sentinel includes any of the following types:

- **[Data connectors](connect-data-sources.md)** provide log ingestion from different sources into Microsoft Sentinel
- **[Parsers](normalization-about-parsers.md)** provide log formatting/transformation into [ASIM](normalization.md) formats, supporting usage across various Microsoft Sentinel content types and scenarios
- **[Workbooks](get-visibility.md)** provide monitoring, visualization, and interactivity with data in Microsoft Sentinel, highlighting meaningful insights for users
- **[Analytics rules](detect-threats-built-in.md)** provide alerts that point to relevant SOC actions via incidents
- **[Hunting queries](hunting.md)** are used by SOC teams to proactively hunt for threats in Microsoft Sentinel
- **[Notebooks](notebooks.md)** help SOC teams use advanced hunting features in Jupyter and Azure Notebooks
- **[Watchlists](watchlists.md)** support the ingestion of *specific* data for enhanced threat detection and reduced alert fatigue
- **[Playbooks and Azure Logic Apps custom connectors](automate-responses-with-playbooks.md)** provide features for automated investigations, remediations, and response scenarios in Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel *solutions* are packages of Microsoft Sentinel content or Microsoft Sentinel API integrations, which fulfill an end-to-end product, domain, or industry vertical scenario in Microsoft Sentinel.

> [!TIP]
> You can either customize out-of-the-box content for your own needs, or you can create your own solution with content to share with others in the community. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel Solutions Build Guide](https://aka.ms/sentinelsolutionsbuildguide) for solutions’ authoring and publishing.

## Discover and manage Microsoft Sentinel content

Use the Microsoft Sentinel **Content hub** to centrally discover and install out-of-the-box (built-in) content.

The Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub provides in-product discoverability, single-step deployment, and enablement of end-to-end product, domain, and/or vertical out-of-the-box solutions and content in Microsoft Sentinel.

- In the **Content hub**, filter by [categories](#microsoft-sentinel-out-of-the-box-content-and-solution-categories) and other parameters, or use the powerful text search, to find the content that works best for your organization's needs. The **Content hub** also indicates the [support model](#microsoft-sentinel-out-of-the-box-content-and-solution-support-models) applied to each piece of content, as some content is maintained by Microsoft and others are maintained by partners or the community.

    Manage [updates for out-of-the-box content](sentinel-solutions-deploy.md#install-or-update-a-solution) via the Microsoft Sentinel **Content hub**, and for custom content via the **Repositories** page.

- Customize out-of-the-box content for your own needs, or create custom content, including analytics rules, hunting queries, notebooks, workbooks, and more. Manage your custom content directly in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, via the [Microsoft Sentinel API](/rest/api/securityinsights/), or in your own source control repository, via the Microsoft Sentinel [Repositories](ci-cd.md) page.

### Why content hub and solutions?

Microsoft Sentinel *solutions* are packaged content or integrations that deliver end-to-end product value for one or more domain or vertical scenarios.

The solutions experience is powered by [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace) for solutions’ discoverability and deployment. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel Solutions Build Guide](https://aka.ms/sentinelsolutionsbuildguide) for solutions authoring and publishing.

Microsoft Sentinel solutions provide in-product discoverability, single-step deployment, and enablement of end-to-end product, domain, and/or vertical scenarios in Microsoft Sentinel. This experience is powered by  for solutions’ discoverability, deployment, and enablement, and by  for solutions’ authoring and publishing.

- **Packaged content** are collections of one or more pieces of Microsoft Sentinel content, such as data connectors, workbooks, analytics rules, playbooks, hunting queries, watchlists, parsers, and more.

- **Integrations** include services or tools built using Microsoft Sentinel or Azure Log Analytics APIs that support integrations between Azure and existing customer applications, or migrate data, queries, and more, from those applications into Microsoft Sentinel.

You can also use solutions to install packages of out-of-the-box content in a single step, where the content is often ready to use immediately. Providers and partners can use solutions to productize investments by delivering combined product, domain, or vertical value.

Use the Content hub to centrally discover and deploy solutions and out-of-the-box content in a scenario-driven manner.
