<!-- docutune:disable -->

Each data connector will have its own set of prerequisites, such as required permissions on your Azure workspace, subscription, or policy, and so on, or other requirements for the partner data source you're connecting to.

Prerequisites for each data connector are listed on the relevant data connector page in Microsoft Sentinel, on the **Instructions** tab.
