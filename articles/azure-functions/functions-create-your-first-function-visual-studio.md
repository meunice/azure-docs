# Quickstart: Create your first C# function in Azure using Visual Studio

Azure Functions lets you run your C# code in a serverless environment in Azure. 

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use Visual Studio to create a C# class library project on .NET 6.0.
> * Create a function that responds to HTTP requests. 
> * Run your code locally to verify function behavior.
> * Deploy your code project to Azure Functions.
 
[!INCLUDE [functions-dotnet-execution-model](../../includes/functions-dotnet-execution-model.md)]

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

There is also a [Visual Studio Code-based version](create-first-function-vs-code-csharp.md) of this article.

## Prerequisites

+ [Visual Studio 2022](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/), which supports .NET 6.0. Make sure to select the **Azure development** workload during installation. 

+ [Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide.md#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing). If you don't already have an account [create a free one](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) before you begin.

## Create a function app project

The Azure Functions project template in Visual Studio creates a C# class library project that you can publish to a function app in Azure. You can use a function app to group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, scaling, and sharing of resources.

1. From the Visual Studio menu, select **File** > **New** > **Project**.

1. In **Create a new project**, enter *functions* in the search box, choose the **Azure Functions** template, and then select **Next**.

1. In **Configure your new project**, enter a **Project name** for your project, and then select **Create**. The function app name must be valid as a C# namespace, so don't use underscores, hyphens, or any other nonalphanumeric characters.

1. For the **Create a new Azure Functions application** settings, use the values in the following table:

    | Setting      | Value  | Description                      |
    | ------------ |  ------- |----------------------------------------- |
    | **.NET version** | **.NET 6** | This value creates a function project that runs in-process with version 4.x of the Azure Functions runtime. You can also choose **.NET 6 (isolated)** to create a project that runs in a separate worker process. Azure Functions 1.x supports the .NET Framework. For more information, see [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](./functions-versions.md).   |
    | **Function template** | **HTTP trigger** | This value creates a function triggered by an HTTP request. |
    | **Storage account (AzureWebJobsStorage)**  | **Storage emulator** | Because a function app in Azure requires a storage account, one is assigned or created when you publish your project to Azure. An HTTP trigger doesn't use an Azure Storage account connection string; all other trigger types require a valid Azure Storage account connection string. When you select this option, the Azurite emulator is used. |
    | **Authorization level** | **Anonymous** | The created function can be triggered by any client without providing a key. This authorization setting makes it easy to test your new function. For more information about keys and authorization, see [Authorization keys](./functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#authorization-keys) and [HTTP and webhook bindings](./functions-bindings-http-webhook.md). |
    
    :::image type="content" source="../../includes/media/functions-vs-tools-create/functions-project-settings-v4.png" alt-text="Azure Functions project settings":::

    Make sure you set the **Authorization level** to **Anonymous**. If you choose the default level of **Function**, you're required to present the [function key](./functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger.md#authorization-keys) in requests to access your function endpoint.

1. Select **Create** to create the function project and HTTP trigger function.

Visual Studio creates a project and class that contains boilerplate code for the HTTP trigger function type. The boilerplate code sends an HTTP response that includes a value from the request body or query string. The `HttpTrigger` attribute specifies that the function is triggered by an HTTP request.

## Rename the function

The `FunctionName` method attribute sets the name of the function, which by default is generated as `Function1`. Since the tooling doesn't let you override the default function name when you create your project, take a minute to create a better name for the function class, file, and metadata.

1. In **File Explorer**, right-click the Function1.cs file and rename it to `HttpExample.cs`.

1. In the code, rename the Function1 class to `HttpExample`.

1. In the `HttpTrigger` method named `Run`, rename the `FunctionName` method attribute to `HttpExample`. 

Your function definition should now look like the following code:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/functions-docs-csharp/http-trigger-template/HttpExample.cs" range="15-18"::: 

Now that you've renamed the function, you can test it on your local computer.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can test your functions locally using the full Azure Functions runtime.  

[!INCLUDE [functions-run-function-test-local-vs](../../includes/functions-run-function-test-local-vs.md)]

After you've verified that the function runs correctly on your local computer, it's time to publish the project to Azure.

## Publish the project to Azure

Before you can publish your project, you must have a function app in your Azure subscription. Visual Studio publishing creates a function app for you the first time you publish your project.

[!INCLUDE [Publish the project to Azure](../../includes/functions-vstools-publish.md)]

## Verify your function in Azure

1. In Cloud Explorer, your new function app should be selected. If not, expand your subscription > **App Services**, and select your new function app.

1. Right-click the function app and choose **Open in Browser**. This opens the root of your function app in your default web browser and displays the page that indicates your function app is running. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/functions-create-your-first-function-visual-studio/function-app-running-azure-v4.png" alt-text="Function app running":::

1. In the address bar in the browser, append the string `/api/HttpExample?name=Functions` to the base URL and run the request.

    The URL that calls your HTTP trigger function is in the following format:

    `http://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

1. Go to this URL and you see a response in the browser to the remote GET request returned by the function, which looks like the following example:

## Clean up resources

Other quickstarts in this collection build upon this quickstart. If you plan to work with subsequent quickstarts, tutorials, or with any of the services you have created in this quickstart, do not clean up the resources.

*Resources* in Azure refer to function apps, functions, storage accounts, and so forth. They're grouped into *resource groups*, and you can delete everything in a group by deleting the group. 

You created resources to complete these quickstarts. You may be billed for these resources, depending on your [account status](https://azure.microsoft.com/account/) and [service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/).

In this quickstart, you used Visual Studio to create and publish a C# function app in Azure with a simple HTTP trigger function.
