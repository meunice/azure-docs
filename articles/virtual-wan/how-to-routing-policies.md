# How to configure Virtual WAN Hub routing intent and routing policies

>[!NOTE] 
> Hub Routing Intent is currently in gated public preview.
> 
> This preview is provided without a service-level agreement and isn't recommended for production workloads. Some features might be unsupported or have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental terms of use for Microsoft Azure previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
> 
> To obtain access to the preview, please deploy two hubs in the same Azure region along side any gateways (Site-to-site VPN Gateways, Point-to-site Gateways and ExpressRouteGateways) and then reach out to previewinterhub@microsoft.com with the Virtual WAN ID, Subscription ID and Azure Region you wish to configure Routing Intent in. Expect a response within 48 business hours (Monday-Friday) with confirmation of feature enablement. Please note that any gateways created after feature enablement will need to be upgraded by the Virtual WAN team.

## Background

Customers using Azure Firewall manager to set up policies for public and private traffic now can set up their networks in a much simpler manner using Routing Intent and Routing Policies.

Routing Intent and Routing policies allow you to specify how the Virtual WAN hub forwards Internet-bound and Private (Point-to-site, Site-to-site, ExpressRoute, Network Virtual Appliances inside the Virtual WAN Hub and Virtual Network) Traffic. There are two types of Routing Policies: Internet Traffic and Private Traffic Routing Policies. Each Virtual WAN Hub may have at most one Internet Traffic Routing Policy and one Private Traffic Routing Policy, each with a single Next Hop resource.

While Private Traffic  includes both branch and Virtual Network address prefixes, Routing Policies considers them as one entity within the Routing Intent Concepts.

>[!NOTE]
> In the gated public preview of Virtual WAN Hub routing policies, inter-hub traffic is only inspected by Azure Firewall or a Network Virtual Appliance deployed in the Virtual WAN Hub if the Virtual WAN Hubs are in the same region.


* **Internet Traffic Routing Policy**:  When an Internet Traffic Routing Policy is configured on a Virtual WAN hub, all branch (User VPN (Point-to-site VPN), Site-to-site VPN, and ExpressRoute) and Virtual Network connections to that Virtual WAN Hub will forward Internet-bound traffic to the Azure Firewall resource, Third-Party Security provider or Network Virtual Appliance specified as part of the Routing Policy.
 
* **Private Traffic Routing Policy**: When a Private Traffic Routing Policy is configured on a Virtual WAN hub, **all** branch and Virtual Network traffic in and out of the Virtual WAN Hub including inter-hub traffic will be forwarded to the Next Hop Azure Firewall resource or Network Virtual Appliance resource that was specified in the Private Traffic Routing Policy. 

    In other words, when a Private Traffic Routing Policy is configured on the Virtual WAN Hub,  all branch-to-branch, branch-to-virtual network, virtual network-to-branch and inter-hub traffic will be sent via Azure Firewall or a Network Virtual Appliance deployed in the Virtual WAN Hub. 


## Key considerations

* You will **not** be able to enable routing policies on your deployments with existing Custom Route tables configured or if there are static routes configured in your Default Route Table.
* Currently, Private Traffic Routing Policies are not supported in Hubs with Encrypted ExpressRoute connections (Site-to-site VPN Tunnel running over ExpressRoute Private connectivity). 
* In the gated public preview of Virtual WAN Hub routing policies, inter-hub traffic is only inspected by Azure Firewall or Network Virtual Appliances deployed in the Virtual WAN Hub if the Virtual WAN Hubs are in the same region.
* Routing Intent and Routing Policies currently must be configured via the custom portal link provided in Step 3 of  **Prerequisites**. Routing Intents and Policies are not supported via Terraform, PowerShell, and CLI. 

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Virtual WAN. Make sure you create at least two Virtual Hubs in the **same** region. For instance, you may create a Virtual WAN with two Virtual Hubs in East US. Note that if you only wish to inspect branch-to-branch traffic, you may deploy a single Virtual WAN Hub as opposed to multiple Hubs in the same region.
2. Convert your Virtual WAN Hub into a Secured Virtual WAN Hub by deploying an Azure Firewall into the Virtual Hubs in the chosen region. For more information on converting your Virtual WAN Hub to a Secured Virtual WAN Hub, please see [How to secure your Virtual WAN Hub](howto-firewall.md).
3. Deploy any Site-to-site VPN, Point-to-site VPN and ExpressRoute Gateways you will use for testing. Reach out to **previewinterhub@microsoft.com**  with the **Virtual WAN Resource ID** and the **Azure Virtual hub Region** you wish to configure Routing Policies in. To locate the Virtual WAN ID, open Azure portal, navigate to your Virtual WAN resource and select Settings > Properties > Resource ID. For example: 
    ```
    /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualWans/<virtualWANname>
    ```
4.  Expect a response within 24-48 hours with confirmation of feature enablement. 
5. Ensure that your Virtual Hubs do **not** have any Custom Route Tables or any  routes you may have added into the defaultRouteTable. You will **not** be able to enable routing policies on your deployments with existing Custom Route tables configured or if there are static routes configured in your Default Route Table. 
6. If you are using an **Azure Firewall** deployed in the Virtual WAN Hub, please reference [Configuring routing policies (through Azure Firewall Manager)](#azurefirewall) to configure routing intent and routing policies. If you are using a **Network Virtual Appliance** deployed in the Virtual WAN Hub, please reference [Configuring routing policies (through Virtual WAN Portal)](#nva) to configure routing intent and routing policies.

## Routing policy configuration examples

The following section describes two common scenarios customers of applying Routing Policies to Secured  Virtual WAN hubs.

### All Virtual WAN Hubs are secured (deployed with Azure Firewall or NVA)

In this scenario, all Virtual WAN hubs are deployed with an Azure Firewall or NVA in them. In this scenario, you may configure an Internet Traffic Routing Policy, a Private Traffic Routing Policy or both on each Virtual WAN Hub.

:::image type="content" source="./media/routing-policies/two-secured-hubs-diagram.png"alt-text="Screenshot showing architecture with two secured hubs."lightbox="./media/routing-policies/two-secured-hubs-diagram.png":::

Consider the following configuration where Hub 1 and Hub 2  have Routing Policies for both Private and Internet Traffic. 

**Hub 1 configuration:**
* Private Traffic  Policy with Next Hop Hub 1 Azure Firewall or NVA
* Internet Traffic Policy with Next Hop Hub 1 Azure Firewall or NVA 

**Hub 2 configuration:**
* Private Traffic  Policy with Next Hop Hub 2 Azure Firewall or NVA
* Internet Traffic Policy with Next Hop Hub 2 Azure Firewall or NVA

The following are the traffic flows that result from such a configuration. 

> [!NOTE]
> Internet Traffic must egress through the **local** Azure Firewall as the default route (0.0.0.0/0) does **not** propagate across hubs.

| From |   To |  Hub 1 VNets | Hub 1 branches | Hub 2 VNets | Hub 2 branches| Internet|
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---| ---| ---| ---|
| Hub 1 VNets     | &#8594;| Hub 1 AzFW  or NVA|   Hub 1 AzFW or NVA    | Hub 1 and 2 AzFW  or NVA | Hub 1 and 2 AzFW  or NVA | Hub 1 AzFW  or NVA |
| Hub 1 Branches   | &#8594;|  Hub 1 AzFW   or NVA|   Hub 1 AzFW or NVA    | Hub 1 and 2 AzFW  or NVA | Hub 1 and 2 AzFW  or NVA | Hub 1 AzFW  or NVA|
| Hub 2 VNets     | &#8594;| Hub 1 and 2 AzFW  or NVA|   Hub 1 and 2 AzFW  or NVA    | Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA | Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA| Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA|
| Hub 2 Branches   | &#8594;|   Hub 1 and 2 AzFW  or NVA  |    Hub 1 and 2 AzFW  or NVA   | Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA |  Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA | Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA|


### Mixture of secured and regular Virtual WAN Hubs 

In this scenario, not all Virtual WAN hubs are deployed with an Azure Firewall or Network Virtual Appliances in them. In this scenario, you may configure an Internet Traffic Routing Policy, a Private Traffic Routing Policy on the secured Virtual WAN Hubs. 

Consider the following configuration where Hub 1 (Normal) and Hub 2 (Secured) are deployed in a Virtual WAN. Hub 2 has Routing Policies for both Private and Internet Traffic. 

**Hub 1 Configuration:**
* N/A (cannot configure Routing Policies if hub is not deployed with Azure Firewall or NVA)

**Hub 2 Configuration:**
* Private Traffic  Policy with Next Hop Hub 2 Azure Firewall or NVA
* Internet Traffic Policy with Next Hop Hub 2 Azure Firewall or NVA 


:::image type="content" source="./media/routing-policies/one-secured-one-normal-diagram.png"alt-text="Screenshot showing architecture with one secured hub one normal hub."lightbox="./media/routing-policies/one-secured-one-normal-diagram.png":::


 The following are the traffic flows that result from such a configuration. Branches and Virtual Networks connected to Hub 1 **cannot** access the Internet via Azure Firewall in the Hub because the default route (0.0.0.0/0) does **not** propagate across hubs.

| From |   To |  Hub 1 VNets | Hub 1 branches | Hub 2 VNets | Hub 2 branches| Internet |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Hub 1 VNets     | &#8594;| Direct |   Direct   | Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA| Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA | - |
| Hub 1 Branches   | &#8594;|  Direct |   Direct    | Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA | Hub 2 AzFW or NVA | - |
| Hub 2 VNets     | &#8594;| Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA|   Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA    | Hub 2 AzFW   or NVA| Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA| Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA|
| Hub 2 Branches   | &#8594;|   Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA  |    Hub 2 AzFW    | Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA|  Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA | Hub 2 AzFW  or NVA|


## Troubleshooting

The following section describes common issues encountered when you configure Routing Policies on your Virtual WAN Hub.  Read the below sections and if your issue is still unresolved,  reach out to previewinterhub@microsoft.com for support. Expect a response within 48 business hours (Monday through Friday).

### Troubleshooting configuration issues
*  Make sure that you have gotten confirmation from previewinterhub@microsoft.com that access to the gated public preview has been granted to your subscription and chosen region. You will **not** be able to configure routing policies without being granted access to the preview.
* After enabling the Routing Policy feature  on your deployment,  ensure you **only** use the custom portal link provided as part of your confirmation email. Do not use PowerShell, CLI, or REST API calls to manage your Virtual WAN deployments.  This includes creating new Branch (Site-to-site VPN, Point-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute) connections.

    >[!NOTE]
    > If you are using Terraform, routing policies are currently not supported.

*  Ensure that your Virtual Hubs do not have any Custom Route Tables or any static routes in the defaultRouteTable. You will **not** be able to select **Enable interhub** from Firewall Manager on your Virtual WAN Hub if there are Custom Route tables configured or if there are static routes in your defaultRouteTable. 

### Troubleshooting data path 

* Currently, using Azure Firewall to inspect inter-hub traffic is only available for Virtual WAN hubs that are deployed in the **same** Azure Region. 
* Currently, Private Traffic Routing Policies are not supported in Hubs with Encrypted ExpressRoute connections (Site-to-site VPN Tunnel running over ExpressRoute Private connectivity).
* You can verify that the Routing Policies have been applied properly by checking the Effective Routes of the DefaultRouteTable. If Private Routing Policies are configured, you should see routes in the DefaultRouteTable for private traffic prefixes with next hop Azure Firewall. If Internet Traffic Routing Policies are configured, you should see a default (0.0.0.0/0) route in the DefaultRouteTable with next hop Azure Firewall.
* If there are any Site-to-site VPN gateways or Point-to-site VPN gateways created **after** the feature has been confirmed to be enabled on your deployment, you will have to reach out again to previewinterhub@microsoft.com to get the feature enabled. 

### Troubleshooting Azure Firewall

* If you are using non [IANA RFC1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918) prefixes in your branches/Virtual Networks, make sure you have specified those prefixes in the "Private Prefixes" text box in Firewall Manager.
* If you have specified non RFC1918 addresses as part of the **Private Traffic Prefixes** text box in Firewall Manager, you may need to configure SNAT policies on your Firewall to disable SNAT for non-RFC1918 private traffic. For more information,  reference the following [document](../firewall/snat-private-range.md). 
* Configure and view Azure Firewall logs to help troubleshoot and analyze your network traffic. For more information on how to set-up monitoring for Azure Firewall,  reference the following [document](../firewall/firewall-diagnostics.md). An overview of the different types of Firewall logs can be found [here](../firewall/logs-and-metrics.md).
* For more information on Azure Firewall,  review [Azure Firewall Documentation](../firewall/overview.md).

## Frequently asked questions

### Why can't I edit the defaultRouteTable from the custom portal link provided by previewinterhub@microsoft.com?

As part of the gated public preview of Routing Policies, your Virtual WAN hub routing is managed entirely by Firewall Manager. Additionally, the managed preview of Routing Policies is **not** supported alongside Custom Routing. Custom Routing with Routing Policies will be supported at a later date. 

However, you can still view the Effective Routes of the DefaultRouteTable by navigating to the **Effective Routes** Tab.

### Can I configure a Routing Policy for Private Traffic and also send Internet Traffic (0.0.0.0/0) via a Network Virtual Appliance in a Spoke Virtual Network?

This scenario is not supported in the gated public preview. However,  reach out to previewinterhub@microsoft.com to express interest in implementing this scenario. 

### Does the default route (0.0.0.0/0) propagate across hubs?

No. Currently, branches and Virtual Networks will egress to the internet using an Azure Firewall deployed inside of the Virtual WAN hub the branches and Virtual Networks are connected to. You cannot configure a connection to access the Internet via the Firewall in a remote hub.

### Why do I see RFC1918 prefixes advertised to my on-premises devices?

When Private Traffic Routing Policies are configured, Virtual WAN Gateways will automatically advertise static routes that are in the default route table (RFC1918 prefixes: 10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16) in addition to the explicit branch and Virtual Network prefixes.
