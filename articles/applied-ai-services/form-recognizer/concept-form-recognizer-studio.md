# Form Recognizer Studio (preview)

>[!NOTE]
> Form Recognizer Studio is currently in public preview. Some features may not be supported or have limited capabilities.

[Form Recognizer Studio preview](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/) is an online tool for visually exploring, understanding, and integrating features from the Form Recognizer service into your applications. Use the [Form Recognizer Studio quickstart](quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio.md) to get started analyzing documents with pre-trained models. Build custom form models and reference the models in your applications using the [Python SDK preview](quickstarts/try-v3-python-sdk.md) and other quickstarts.

The following image shows the Invoice prebuilt model feature at work.

## Form Recognizer Studio features

The following Form Recognizer service features are available in the Studio.

* **Layout**: Try out Form Recognizer's Layout feature to extract text, tables, selection marks, and structure information from documents—PDF, TIFF—and images—JPG, PNG, BMP. Start with the [Studio Layout quickstart](quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio.md#layout). Explore with sample documents and your documents. Use the interactive visualization and JSON output to understand how the feature works. See the [Layout overview](concept-layout.md) to learn more and get started with the [Python SDK quickstart for Layout](quickstarts/try-v3-python-sdk.md#layout-model).

* **Prebuilt models**: Form Recognizer's pre-built models enable you to add intelligent form processing to your apps and flows without having to train and build your own models. Start with the [Studio Prebuilts quickstart](quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio.md#prebuilt-models). Explore with sample documents and your documents. Use the interactive visualization, extracted fields list, and JSON output to understand how the feature works. See the [Models overview](concept-model-overview.md) to learn more and get started with the [Python SDK quickstart for Prebuilt Invoice](quickstarts/try-v3-python-sdk.md#prebuilt-model).

* **Custom models**: Form Recognizer's custom models enable you to extract fields and values from models trained with your data, tailored to your forms and documents. Create standalone custom models or combine two or more custom models to create a composed model to extract data from multiple form types. Start with the [Studio Custom models quickstart](quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio.md#custom-projects).  Use the online wizard, labeling interface, training step, and visualizations to understand how the feature works. Test the custom model with your sample documents and iterate to improve the model. See the [Custom models overview](concept-custom.md) to learn more and use the [Form Recognizer v3.0 preview migration guide](v3-migration-guide.md) to start integrating the new models with your applications.

* **Custom models: Labeling features**: Form Recognizer Custom model creation requires identifying the fields to be extracted and labeling  those fields before training the custom models. Labeling text, selection marks, tabular data, and other content types are typically assisted with a user interface to ease the training workflow. For example, use the [Label as tables](quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio.md#labeling-as-tables) and [Labeling for signature detection](quickstarts/try-v3-form-recognizer-studio.md#labeling-for-signature-detection) quickstarts to understand the labeling experience in Form Recognizer Studio.

## Next steps

* Follow our [**Form Recognizer v3.0 migration guide**](v3-migration-guide.md) to learn the differences from the previous version of the REST API.
* Explore our [**preview SDK quickstarts**](quickstarts/try-v3-python-sdk.md) to try the preview features in your applications using the new SDKs.
* Refer to our [**preview REST API quickstarts**](quickstarts/try-v3-rest-api.md) to try the preview features using the new REST API.
