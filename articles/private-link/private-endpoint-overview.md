# What is Azure Private Endpoint?

A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. By enabling a private endpoint, you're bringing the service into your virtual network.

The service could be an Azure service such as:

* Azure Storage
* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure SQL Database
* Your own service using a [Private Link Service](private-link-service-overview.md).
  
## Private Endpoint properties 
 A Private Endpoint specifies the following properties: 

|Property  |Description |
|---------|---------|
|Name    |    A unique name within the resource group.      |
|Subnet    |  The subnet to deploy and where the private IP address is assigned. For subnet requirements, see the limitations section in this article.         |
|Private Link Resource    |   The private link resource to connect using resource ID or alias, from the list of available types. A unique network identifier will be generated for all traffic sent to this resource.       |
|Target subresource   |      The subresource to connect. Each private link resource type has different options to select based on preference.    |
|Connection approval method    |  Automatic or manual. Depending on Azure role based access control permissions, your private endpoint can be approved automatically. If you try to connect to a private link resource without Azure role-based access control, use the manual method to allow the owner of the resource to approve the connection.        |
|Request Message     |  You can specify a message for requested connections to be approved manually. This message can be used to identify a specific request.        |
|Connection status   |   A read-only property that specifies if the private endpoint is active. Only private endpoints in an approved state can be used to send traffic. More states available: <br>-**Approved**: Connection was automatically or manually approved and is ready to be used.</br><br>-**Pending**: Connection was created manually and is pending approval by the private link resource owner.</br><br>-**Rejected**: Connection was rejected by the private link resource owner.</br><br>-**Disconnected**: Connection was removed by the private link resource owner. The private endpoint becomes informative and should be deleted for cleanup. </br>|

Some key details about private endpoints: 

- Private endpoint enables connectivity between the consumers from the same:
    
    - Virtual Network
    - Regionally peered virtual networks
    - Globally peered virtual networks
    - On premises using [VPN](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/vpn-gateway/) or [Express Route](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute/)
    - Services powered by Private Link
 
- Network connections can only be initiated by clients connecting to the private endpoint. Service providers don't have routing configuration to create connections into service consumers. Connections can only be established in a single direction.

- When creating a private endpoint, a read-only network interface is created for the lifecycle of the resource. The interface is assigned a dynamic private IP address from the subnet that maps to the private link resource. The value of the private IP address remains unchanged for the entire lifecycle of the private endpoint.
 
- The private endpoint must be deployed in the same region and subscription as the virtual network. 
 
- The private link resource can be deployed in a different region than the virtual network and private endpoint.
 
- Multiple private endpoints can be created using the same private link resource. For a single network using a common DNS server configuration, the recommended practice is to use a single private endpoint for a given private link resource. Use this practice to avoid duplicate entries or conflicts in DNS resolution. 
 
- Multiple private endpoints can be created on the same or different subnets within the same virtual network. There are limits to the number of private endpoints you can create in a subscription. For details, see [Azure limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#networking-limits).

- The subscription from the private link resource must also be registered with Microsoft. Network resource provider. For details, see [Azure Resource Providers](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md).

## Network security of private endpoints 

When using private endpoints, traffic is secured to a private link resource. The platform does an access control to validate network connections reaching only the specified private link resource. To access more resources within the same Azure service, extra private endpoints are required. 
 
You can completely lock down your workloads from accessing public endpoints to connect to a supported Azure service. This control provides an extra network security layer to your resources. The security provides protection that prevents access to other resources hosted on the same Azure service. 
 
## Access to a private link resource using approval workflow 
You can connect to a private link resource using the following connection approval methods:
- **Automatically** approved when you own or have permission on the specific private link resource. The permission required is based on the private link resource type in the following format: Microsoft.\<Provider>/<resource_type>/privateEndpointConnectionsApproval/action
- **Manual** request when you don't have the permission required and would like to request access. An approval workflow will be initiated. The private endpoint and later private endpoint connections will be created in a "Pending" state. The private link resource owner is responsible to approve the connection. After it's approved, the private endpoint is enabled to send traffic normally, as shown in the following approval workflow diagram.  

![workflow approval](media/private-endpoint-overview/private-link-paas-workflow.png)
 
The private link resource owner can do the following actions over a private endpoint connection: 

- Review all private endpoint connections details. 
- Approve a private endpoint connection. The corresponding private endpoint will be enabled to send traffic to the private link resource. 
- Reject a private endpoint connection. The corresponding private endpoint will be updated to reflect the status.
- Delete a private endpoint connection in any state. The corresponding private endpoint will be updated with a disconnected state to reflect the action, the private endpoint owner can only delete the resource at this point. 
 
> [!NOTE]
> Only a private endpoint in an approved state can send traffic to a given private link resource. 

### Connect with alias

An alias is a unique moniker that is generated when the service owner creates the private link service behind a standard load balancer. Service owners can share this alias with their consumers offline. 

Consumers can request a connection to private link service using either the resource URI or the alias. If you want to connect using the alias, you must create a private endpoint using the manual connection approval method. For using manual connection approval method, set manual request parameter to true during private endpoint create flow. For more information, see [New-AzPrivateEndpoint](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azprivateendpoint) and [az network private-endpoint create](/cli/azure/network/private-endpoint#az_network_private_endpoint_create).

## DNS configuration

The DNS settings used for connections to a private link resource are important. Ensure your DNS settings are correct when you use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the connection. The settings must resolve to the private IP address of the private endpoint. Existing Azure services might already have a DNS configuration to use when connecting over a public endpoint. This configuration must be overwritten to connect using your private endpoint. 
 
The network interface associated with the private endpoint contains the information required to configure your DNS. The information includes the FQDN and private IP address for a private link resource. 

For complete detailed information about recommendations to configure DNS for private endpoints, see [Private Endpoint DNS configuration](private-endpoint-dns.md).
 
## Limitations
 
The following table includes a list of known limitations when using private endpoints: 

| Limitation | Description |Mitigation |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Traffic destined to a private endpoint using a user-defined route may be asymmetric. | Return traffic from a private endpoint bypasses a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) and attempts to return to the source VM. | Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) is used to ensure symmetric routing. For all traffic destined to a private endpoint using a UDR, it's recommended to use SNAT for traffic at the NVA. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NSG and UDR support for private endpoints are in public preview on select regions. For more information, see [Public preview of Private Link UDR Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/public-preview-of-private-link-udr-support/) and [Public preview of Private Link Network Security Group Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/public-preview-of-private-link-network-security-group-support/).
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Public preview limitations

### NSG

| Limitation | Description | Mitigation |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Obtain effective routes and security rules won't be available on a private endpoint network interface. | You aren't able to navigate to the network interface to see relevant information on the effective routes and security rules. | Q4CY21 |
| NSG flow logs not supported. | NSG flow logs won't work for inbound traffic destined for a private endpoint. | No information at this time. |
| Intermittent drops with ZRS storage accounts. | Customers using ZRS storage account may see periodic intermittent drops even with allow NSG applied on storage private endpoint subnet. | September |
| Intermittent drops with Azure Key Vault. | Customers using Azure Key Vault may see periodic intermittent drops even with allow NSG applied on Azure Key Vault private endpoint subnet. | September |
| Limit on number of address prefixes per NSG. | Having more than 500 address prefixes in NSG in a single rule isn't supported. | September |
| AllowVirtualNetworkAccess flag | Customers setting VNet peering on their VNet (VNet A) with **AllowVirtualNetworkAccess** flag set to false on the peering link to another VNet (VNet B) can't use the **VirtualNetwork** tag to deny traffic from VNet B accessing private endpoint resources. They'll need to explicitly place a block for VNet B’s address prefix to deny traffic to the private endpoint. | September |
| Dual port NSG rules unsupported. | If multiple port ranges are used with NSG rules, only the first port range is honored for allow rules and deny rules. Rules with multiple port ranges are defaulted to deny all instead of specific ports. </br> **For more information, see rule example below.** | September |

| Priority | Source port | Destination port | Action | Effective action |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| 10 | 10-12 | 10-12 | Allow/Deny | Single port range in source/destination ports will work as expected. |
| 10 | 10-12, 13-14 | 14-15, 16-17 | Allow | Only source ports 10-12 and destination ports 14-15 will be allowed. |
| 10 | 10-12, 13-14 | 120-130, 140-150 | Deny | Traffic from all source ports will be denied to all dest ports since there are multiple source and destination port ranges. |
| 10 | 10-12, 13-14 | 120-130 | Deny | Traffic from all source ports will be denied to destination ports 120-130 only. There are multiple source port ranges and a single destination port range. |

**Table: Example dual port rule.**

### UDR

| Limitation | Description | Mitigation |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) is recommended always. | Because of the variable nature of the private endpoint data-plane, it's recommended to SNAT traffic destined to a private endpoint to ensure return traffic is honored. | No information at this time. |
