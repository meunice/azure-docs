# Deploy self-hosted gateway to Kubernetes

This article describes the steps for deploying self-hosted gateway component of Azure API Management to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md)
- Create a Kubernetes cluster.
> [!TIP]
> [Single-node clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/#learning-environment) work well for development and evaluation purposes. Use [Kubernetes Certified](https://kubernetes.io/partners/#conformance) multi-node clusters on-premises or in the cloud for production workloads.
- [Provision a self-hosted gateway resource in your API Management instance](api-management-howto-provision-self-hosted-gateway.md).

## Deploy to Kubernetes

1. Select **Gateways** from under **Deployment and infrastructure**.
2. Select the self-hosted gateway resource you intend to deploy.
3. Select **Deployment**.
4. Note that an access token in the **Token** text box was autogenerated for you using the default **Expiry** and **Secret key** values. If needed, pick desired values in either or both controls to generate a new token.
5. Select **Kubernetes** tab under **Deployment scripts**.
6. Click on the **<gateway-name>.yml** file link and download the YAML file.
7. Select **copy** icon located at the bottom right corner of the **Deploy** text box to save the `kubectl` commands to the clipboard.
8. Paste commands to the terminal (or command) window. The first command creates a Kubernetes secret containing access token generated in step 4. Second command applies the configuration file downloaded in step 6 to the Kubernetes cluster and expects the the file to be present in the current directory.
9. Execute the commands to create the necessary Kubernetes objects in the [default namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) and start self-hosted gateway pod(s) from [container image](https://aka.ms/apim/sputnik/dhub) downloaded from the Microsoft Container Registry.
10. Execute command shown bellow to check if the deployment succeeded . Note that it might take a little time for all the objects to be created and for pod(s) to initialize.
```console
kubectl get deployments
NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
<gateway-name>   1/1     1            1           18s
```
11. Execute command shown bellow to check if the service was successfully created. Note that your service IPs and ports will be different.
```console
kubectl get services
NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
<gateway-name>   LoadBalancer   10.99.236.168   <pending>     80:31620/TCP,443:30456/TCP   9m1s
```
12. Go back to the Azure portal and select **Overview**.
13. **Status** showing a green checkmark icon followed by the node count matching the number of replicas specified in the YAML file confirms that deployed self-hosted gateway pods are successfully communicating with the API Management service and have a regular "heartbeat".

> [!TIP]
> Execute <code>kubectl logs deployment/<gateway-name></code> command to view logs from a randomly selected pod if there are more than one.
> Execute <code>kubectl logs -h</code> for a complete set of command options, e.g. how to view logs for a specific pod or container.

## Production deployment considerations

### Access token
Without a valid access token self-hosted gateway is unable to access and download configuration from configuration data endpoint of the associated API Management service. Access token can be valid for a maximum of 30 days. It must be regenerated and the cluster configured with a fresh token either manually or via automation before it expires. When automating token refresh use this management API [operation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/apimanagement/2019-12-01/gateway/generatetoken) to generated a new token. Follow this [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret) for information on managing Kubernetes secrets.

### Namespace
Kubernetes [namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) help with dividing a single cluster among multiple teams, projects, or applications. Namespaces provide a scope for resources and names and can be associated with a resource quota and access control policies.
Commands provided in the Azure portal create self-hosted gateway resources in the **default** namespace which is automatically created, exists in every cluster, and can't be deleted.
Consider [creating and deploying](https://kubernetesbyexample.com/ns/) self-hosted gateway into a separate namespace in production.

### Number of replicas
Minimal number of replicas suitable in production is two.

By default, self-hosted gateway is deployed with a **RollingUpdate** deployment [strategy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#strategy). Review the default values and consider explicitly setting [**maxUnavailable**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#max-unavailable) and [**maxSurge**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#max-surge) fields, especially when using a high replica count.

### Container resources
By default, the YAML file provided in the Azure portal doesn't specify container resource requests.

It's impossible to reliably predict and recommend the amount of per-container CPU and memory resources and the number of replicas required for supporting a specific workload due to many factors at play, e.g.:

- Specific hardware the cluster is running on
- Presence and type of virtualization
- Number and rate of concurrent client connections
- Request rate
- Kind and number of configured policies
- Payload size and if payloads are buffered or streamed
- Backend service latency

We recommend setting resource request to 2 cores and 2 GiB as a starting point, performing a load test and scaling up/out or down/in based the results.

### Container image tag
The YAML file provided in the Azure portal uses the **latest** tag which always references the most recent version of the self-hosted gateway container image.

Consider using a specific version tag in production to avoid unintentional upgrade to a newer version.

Follow this [link](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/azure-api-management/gateway/tags/list) to see the full list of available tags.

### DNS policy
DNS name resolution plays a critical role in self-hosted gateway's ability to connect to dependencies in Azure and dispatch API calls to backend services.

The YAML file provided in the Azure portal applies the default [**ClusterFirst**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-policy) policy which causes name resolution requests not resolved by the cluster DNS to be forwarded to the upstream DNS server inherited from the node.

Follow this [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service) to learn about name resolution in Kubernetes and consider customizing [DNS policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-policy) or D[NS configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-config) as appropriate for your setup.

### Configuration backup
Follow this [link](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#connectivity-to-azure) to learn about self-hosted gateway behavior in the presence of a temporary Azure connectivity outage.
Configure local storage volume for the self-hosted gateway container, so it can persist a backup copy of the latest downloaded configuration and, if connectivity is down, use it upon restart. The volume mount path must be  <code>/apim/config</code>. See an example [here](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-self-hosted-gateway/blob/master/examples/self-hosted-gateway-with-configuration-backup.yaml).
To learn about storage in Kubernetes follow this [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/).

### Local logs and metrics
Self-hosted gateway sends telemetry to [Azure Monitor](api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor.md) and [Azure Application Insights](api-management-howto-app-insights.md) per configuration settings in the associated API Management service.
When [connectivity to Azure](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#connectivity-to-azure) is temporarily lost, the flow of telemetry to Azure is interrupted and the data is lost for the duration of the outage.
Consider [setting up local monitoring](how-to-configure-local-metrics-logs.md) to ensure ability to observe the API traffic and prevent telemetry loss during Azure connectivity outages.
