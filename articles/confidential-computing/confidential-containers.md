# Confidential containers on Azure

Azure confidential computing offers confidential containers. There are multiple [options you can choose for confidential containers](choose-confidential-containers-offerings.md). Secured and isolated environments with attestation, improve the overall security of your container deployments. 

A hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) provides strong assurances. A TEE provides hardware and software measurements from trusted computing base (TCB) components. Confidential containers offerings on Azure allow verification of these measurements and validate if the container applications run in a verifiable execution environment.

Confidential containers support custom applications developed with any programming languages. You can also run Docker containers off the shelf.

## Enablers with Intel SGX on Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS)

 To run an existing Docker container, applications on confidential computing nodes require an abstraction layer or Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) software to use the special CPU instruction set. Configure SGX to protect your sensitive application code. SGX creates a direct execution to the CPU to remove the guest operating system (OS), host OS, or hypervisor from the trust boundary. This step reduces the overall surface attack areas and vulnerabilities.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) fully supports confidential containers. You can run existing containers confidentially on AKS.

## Partner enablers

You can enable confidential containers in Azure Partners and Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Developers can choose software providers based on their features, integration with Azure services and tooling support. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Partners offer the following solutions. These solutions might incur licensing fees. Verify all partner software terms independently. 

### Fortanix

[Fortanix](https://www.fortanix.com/) has portal and Command Line Interface (CLI) experiences to convert their containerized applications to SGX-capable confidential containers. You don't need to modify or recompile the application. Fortanix provides the flexibility to run and manage a broad set of applications. You can use existing applications, new enclave-native applications, and pre-packaged applications. Start with Fortanix's [Enclave Manager](https://em.fortanix.com/) UI or [REST APIs](https://www.fortanix.com/api/em/). Create confidential containers using the Fortanix's [quickstart guide for AKS](https://support.fortanix.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049658291-Fortanix-Confidential-Container-on-Azure-Kubernetes-Service).

### SCONE (Scontain)

[SCONE](https://scontain.com/) (Scontain) security policies generate certificates, keys, and secrets. Only services with attestation for an application see these credentials. Application services automatically do attestation for each other through TLS. You don't need to modify the applications or TLS. For more explanation, see SCONE's [Flask application demo](https://sconedocs.github.io/flask_demo/).

SCONE can convert most existing binaries into applications that run inside enclaves. You don't need to change or recompile the application. SCONE also protects interpreted languages like Python by encrypting both data files and Python code files. You can use SCONE security policies to protect encrypted files against unauthorized access, modifications, and rollbacks. For more information, see SCONE's documentation on [how to use SCONE with an existing Python application](https://sconedocs.github.io/sconify_image/).

![Diagram of SCONE workflow, showing how SCONE processes binary images.](./media/confidential-containers/scone-workflow.png)

You can deploy SCONE on Azure confidential computing nodes with AKS. This process is fully supported and integrated. For more information, see the [SCONE sample AKS application](https://sconedocs.github.io/aks/).

### Anjuna

[Anjuna](https://www.anjuna.io/) provides SGX platform software to run unmodified containers on AKS. For more information, see Anjuna's [documentation about functionality and sample applications](https://www.anjuna.io/microsoft-azure-confidential-computing-aks-lp).

Get started with a sample Redis Cache and Python Custom Application [here](https://www.anjuna.io/microsoft-azure-confidential-computing-aks-lp)

## OSS enablers

> [!NOTE]
> Open-source projects offer the following solutions. Azure confidential computing and Microsoft aren't directly affiliated with these projects and solutions.  

### Gramine

[Gramine](https://grapheneproject.io/) is a lightweight guest OS, designed to run a single Linux application with minimal host requirements. Gramine can run applications in an isolated environment. There's tooling support for converting existing Docker container applications to Gramine Shielded Containers (GSCs).

For more information, see the Gramine's [sample application and deployment on AKS](https://graphene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cloud-deployment.html#azure-kubernetes-service-aks)

### Occlum

[Occlum](https://occlum.io/) is a memory-safe, multi-process library OS (LibOS) for Intel SGX. The OS enables legacy applications to run on SGX with little to no modifications to source code. Occlum transparently protects the confidentiality of user workloads while allowing an easy "lift and shift" to existing Docker applications.

Occlum supports AKS deployments. For more information, see Occlum's [deployment instructions and sample apps](https://github.com/occlum/occlum/blob/master/docs/azure_aks_deployment_guide.md).

### Marblerun

[Marblerun](https://marblerun.sh/) is an orchestration framework for confidential containers. You can run and scale confidential services on SGX-enabled Kubernetes. Marblerun takes care of boilerplate tasks like verifying the services in your cluster, managing secrets for them, and establishing enclave-to-enclave mTLS connections between them. Marblerun also ensures that your cluster of confidential containers adheres to a manifest defined in simple JSON. You can verify the manifest with external clients through remote attestation.

This framework extends the confidentiality, integrity, and verifiability properties of a single enclave to a Kubernetes cluster.

Marblerun supports confidential containers created with Graphene, Occlum, and EGo, with [examples for each SDK](https://docs.edgeless.systems/marblerun/#/examples?id=examples). The framework runs on Kubernetes alongside your existing cloud-native tooling. There's a CLI and helm charts. Marblerun also supports confidential computing nodes on AKS. Follow Marblerun's [guide to deploy Marblerun on AKS](https://docs.edgeless.systems/marblerun/#/deployment/cloud?id=cloud-deployment).
