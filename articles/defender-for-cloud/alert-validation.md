# Alert validation in Microsoft Defender for Cloud

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

This document helps you learn how to verify if your system is properly configured for Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts.

## What are security alerts?
Alerts are the notifications that Defender for Cloud generates when it detects threats on your resources. It prioritizes and lists the alerts along with the information needed to quickly investigate the problem. Defender for Cloud also provides recommendations for how you can remediate an attack.
For more information, see [Security alerts in Defender for Cloud](alerts-overview.md) and [Managing and responding to security alerts](managing-and-responding-alerts.md)


## Generate sample security alerts

If you're using the new, preview alerts experience as described in [Manage and respond to security alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](managing-and-responding-alerts.md), you can create sample alerts in a few clicks from the security alerts page in the Azure portal.

Use sample alerts to:

- evaluate the value and capabilities of your Microsoft Defender plans
- validate any configurations you've made for your security alerts (such as SIEM integrations,  workflow automation, and email notifications)

To create sample alerts:

1. As a user with the role **Subscription Contributor**, from the toolbar on the alerts page, select **Create sample alerts**.
1. Select the subscription.
1. Select the relevant Microsoft Defender plan/s for which you want to see alerts. 
1. Select **Create sample alerts**.

    A notification appears letting you know that the sample alerts are being created:

    :::image type="content" source="media/alert-validation/notification-sample-alerts-creation.png" alt-text="Notification that the sample alerts are being generated.":::

    After a few minutes, the alerts appear in the security alerts page. They'll also appear anywhere else that you've configured to receive your Microsoft Defender for Cloud security alerts (connected SIEMs, email notifications, and so on).

    > [!TIP]
    > The alerts are for simulated resources.

## Simulate alerts on your Azure VMs (Windows) <a name="validate-windows"></a>

After the Log Analytics agent is installed on your machine, follow these steps from the computer where you want to be the attacked resource of the alert:

1. Copy an executable (for example **calc.exe**) to the computer's desktop, or other directory of your convenience, and rename it as **ASC_AlertTest_662jfi039N.exe**.
1. Open the command prompt and execute this file with an argument (just a fake argument name), such as: ```ASC_AlertTest_662jfi039N.exe -foo```
1. Wait 5 to 10 minutes and open Defender for Cloud Alerts. An alert should appear.

> [!NOTE]
> When reviewing this test alert for Windows, make sure the field **Arguments Auditing Enabled** is **true**. If it is **false**, then you need to enable command-line arguments auditing. To enable it, use the following command:
>
>```reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system\Audit" /f /v "ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled"```

## Simulate alerts on your Azure VMs (Linux) <a name="validate-linux"></a>

After the Log Analytics agent is installed on your machine, follow these steps from the computer where you want to be the attacked resource of the alert:

1. Copy an executable to a convenient location and rename it to `./asc_alerttest_662jfi039n`. For example:

    `cp /bin/echo ./asc_alerttest_662jfi039n`

1. Open the command prompt and execute this file:

    `./asc_alerttest_662jfi039n testing eicar pipe`

1. Wait 5 to 10 minutes and then open Defender for Cloud Alerts. An alert should appear.

## Simulate alerts on Kubernetes <a name="validate-kubernetes"></a>

If you've integrated Azure Kubernetes Service with Defender for Cloud, you can test that your alerts are working with the following kubectl command:

`kubectl get pods --namespace=asc-alerttest-662jfi039n`
