#  Connect your AWS accounts to Microsoft Defender for Cloud

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](./includes/banner.md)]

With cloud workloads commonly spanning multiple cloud platforms, cloud security services must do the same.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects workloads in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

To protect your AWS-based resources, you can connect an account with one of two mechanisms:

- **Classic cloud connectors experience** - As part of the initial multi-cloud offering, we introduced these cloud connectors as a way to connect your AWS and GCP accounts. If you've already configured an AWS connector through the classic cloud connectors experience, we recommend deleting these connectors (as explained in [Remove classic connectors](#remove-classic-connectors)), and connecting the account again using the newer mechanism. If you don't do this before creating the new connector through the environment settings page, do so afterwards to avoid seeing duplicate recommendations.

- **Environment settings page (in preview)** (recommended) - This preview page provides a greatly improved, simpler, onboarding experience (including auto provisioning). This mechanism also extends Defender for Cloud's enhanced security features to your AWS resources:

    - **Defender for Cloud's CSPM features** extend to your AWS resources. This agentless plan assesses your AWS resources according to AWS-specific security recommendations and these are included in your secure score. The resources will also be assessed for compliance with built-in standards specific to AWS (AWS CIS, AWS PCI DSS, and AWS Foundational Security Best Practices). Defender for Cloud's [asset inventory page](asset-inventory.md) is a multi-cloud enabled feature helping you manage your AWS resources alongside your Azure resources.
    - **Microsoft Defender for Containers** extends Defender for Cloud's container threat detection and advanced defenses to your **Amazon EKS clusters**.
    - **Microsoft Defender for servers** brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your Windows and Linux EC2 instances. This plan includes the integrated license for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, security baselines and OS level assessments, vulnerability assessment scanning, adaptive application controls (AAC), file integrity monitoring (FIM), and more.

For a reference list of all the recommendations Defender for Cloud can provide for AWS resources, see [Security recommendations for AWS resources - a reference guide](recommendations-reference-aws.md).

This screenshot shows AWS accounts displayed in Defender for Cloud's [overview dashboard](overview-page.md).

## Prerequisites

- To connect an AWS account to your Azure subscription, you'll obviously need access to an AWS account.

- **To enable the Defender for Kubernetes plan**, you'll need:
    - At least one Amazon EKS cluster with permission to access to the EKS K8s API server. If you need to create a new EKS cluster, follow the instructions in [Getting started with Amazon EKS – eksctl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html).
    - The resource capacity to create a new SQS queue, Kinesis Fire Hose delivery stream, and S3 bucket in the cluster's region.

- **To enable the Defender for servers plan**, you'll need:
    - Microsoft Defender for servers enabled (see [Quickstart: Enable enhanced security features](enable-enhanced-security.md).
    - An active AWS account with EC2 instances managed by AWS Systems Manager (SSM) and using SSM agent. Some Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) have the SSM agent pre-installed, their AMIs are listed in [AMIs with SSM Agent preinstalled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent-technical-details.html#ami-preinstalled-agent). If your EC2 instances don't have the SSM Agent, follow the relevant instructions from Amazon:
        - [Install SSM Agent for a hybrid environment (Windows)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-managed-win.html)
        - [Install SSM Agent for a hybrid environment (Linux)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-managed-linux.html)


## Connect your AWS account

Follow the steps below to create your AWS cloud connector. 

### Remove 'classic' connectors

If you have any existing connectors created with the classic cloud connectors experience, remove them first:

1. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open **Environment settings** and select the option to switch back to the classic connectors experience.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/classic-connectors-experience.png" alt-text="Switching back to the classic cloud connectors experience in Defender for Cloud.":::From Defender for Cloud's menu, open **Environment settings**.

1. For each connector, select the “…” at the end of the row, and select **Delete**.

1. On AWS, delete the role ARN or the credentials created for the integration.

### Create a new connector

1. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open **Environment settings**.
1. Select **Add environment** > **Amazon Web Services**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-aws/add-aws-account-environment-settings.png" alt-text="Connecting an AWS account to an Azure subscription.":::

1. Enter the details of the AWS account, including the location where you'll store the connector resource, and select **Next: Select plans**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-aws/add-aws-account-details.png" alt-text="Step 1 of the add AWS account wizard: Enter the account details.":::

1. The select plans tab is where you choose which Defender for Cloud capabilities to enable for this AWS account. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Each capability has its own requirements for permissions and might incur charges.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-aws/add-aws-account-plans-selection.png" alt-text="The select plans tab is where you choose which Defender for Cloud capabilities to enable for this AWS account.":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To present the current status of your recommendations, the CSPM plan queries the AWS resource APIs several times a day. These read-only API calls incur no charges, but they *are* registered in CloudTrail if you've enabled a trail for read events. As explained in [the AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing/), there are no additional charges for keeping one trail. If you're exporting the data out of AWS (for example, to an external SIEM), this increased volume of calls might also increase ingestion costs. In such cases, We recommend filtering out the read-only calls from the Defender for Cloud user or role ARN: arn:aws:iam::[accountId]:role/CspmMonitorAws (this is the default role name, confirm the role name  configured on your account).

    - To extend Defender for Servers coverage to your AWS EC2, set the **Servers** plan to **On** and edit the configuration as required. 

    - For Defender for Kubernetes to protect your AWS EKS clusters, Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes and the Defender extension should be installed. Set the **Containers** plan to **On**, and use the dedicated Defender for Cloud recommendation to deploy the extension (and Arc, if necessary) as explained in [Protect Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service clusters](defender-for-kubernetes-introduction.md#protect-amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-clusters).

1. Complete the setup:
    1. Select **Next: Configure access**.
    1. Download the CloudFormation template.
    1. Using the downloaded CloudFormation template, create the stack in AWS as instructed on screen.
    1. Select **Next: Review and generate**.
    1. Select **Create**.

Defender for Cloud will immediately start scanning your AWS resources and you'll see security recommendations within a few hours. For a reference list of all the recommendations Defender for Cloud can provide for AWS resources, see [Security recommendations for AWS resources - a reference guide](recommendations-reference-aws.md).

## Connect your AWS account

Follow the steps below to create your AWS cloud connector. 

### Step 1. Set up AWS Security Hub:

1. To view security recommendations for multiple regions, repeat the following steps for each relevant region.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you're using an AWS management account, repeat the following three steps to configure the management account and all connected member accounts across all relevant regions

    1. Enable [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gs-console.html).
    1. Enable [AWS Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-settingup.html).
    1. Verify that data is flowing to the Security Hub. When you first enable Security Hub, it might take several hours for data to be available.

### Step 2. Set up authentication for Defender for Cloud in AWS

There are two ways to allow Defender for Cloud to authenticate to AWS:

- **Create an IAM role for Defender for Cloud** (Recommended) - The most secure method
- **AWS user for Defender for Cloud** - A less secure option if you don't have IAM enabled

#### Create an IAM role for Defender for Cloud
1. From your Amazon Web Services console, under **Security, Identity & Compliance**, select **IAM**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-onboard-aws/aws-identity-and-compliance.png" alt-text="AWS services.":::

1. Select **Roles** and **Create role**.
1. Select **Another AWS account**.
1. Enter the following details:

    - **Account ID** - enter the Microsoft Account ID (**158177204117**) as shown in the AWS connector page in Defender for Cloud.
    - **Require External ID** - should be selected
    - **External ID** - enter the subscription ID as shown in the AWS connector page in Defender for Cloud 

1. Select **Next**.
1. In the **Attach permission policies** section, select the following [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html):

    - SecurityAudit (`arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecurityAudit`)
    - AmazonSSMAutomationRole (`arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonSSMAutomationRole`)
    - AWSSecurityHubReadOnlyAccess (`arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSSecurityHubReadOnlyAccess`)

1. Optionally add tags. Adding Tags to the user doesn't affect the connection.
1. Select **Next**.

1. In The Roles list, choose the role you created

1. Save the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for later. 

#### Create an AWS user for Defender for Cloud 
1. Open the **Users** tab and select **Add user**.
1. In the **Details** step, enter a username for Defender for Cloud and ensure that you select **Programmatic access** for the AWS Access Type. 
1. Select **Next Permissions**.
1. Select **Attach existing policies directly** and apply the following policies:
    - SecurityAudit
    - AmazonSSMAutomationRole
    - AWSSecurityHubReadOnlyAccess
    
1. Select **Next: Tags**. Optionally add tags. Adding Tags to the user doesn't affect the connection.
1. Select **Review**.
1. Save the automatically generated **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** CSV file for later.
1. Review the summary and select **Create user**.


### Step 3. Configure the SSM Agent

AWS Systems Manager is required for automating tasks across your AWS resources. If your EC2 instances don't have the SSM Agent, follow the relevant instructions from Amazon:

- [Installing and Configuring SSM Agent on Windows Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-win.html)
- [Installing and Configuring SSM Agent on Amazon EC2 Linux Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-agent.html)


### Step 4. Complete Azure Arc prerequisites
1. Make sure the appropriate [Azure resources providers](../azure-arc/servers/agent-overview.md#register-azure-resource-providers) are registered:
    - Microsoft.HybridCompute
    - Microsoft.GuestConfiguration

1. Create a Service Principal for onboarding at scale. As an **Owner** on the subscription you want to use for the onboarding, create a service principal for Azure Arc onboarding as described in [Create a Service Principal for onboarding at scale](../azure-arc/servers/onboard-service-principal.md#create-a-service-principal-for-onboarding-at-scale).


### Step 5. Connect AWS to Defender for Cloud

1. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open **Environment settings** and select the option to switch back to the classic connectors experience.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/classic-connectors-experience.png" alt-text="Switching back to the classic cloud connectors experience in Defender for Cloud.":::

1. Select **Add AWS account**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-onboard-aws/add-aws-account.png" alt-text="Add AWS account button on Defender for Cloud's multi-cloud connectors page":::
1. Configure the options in the **AWS authentication** tab:
    1. Enter a **Display name** for the connector.
    1. Confirm that the subscription is correct. It's the subscription that will include the connector and AWS Security Hub recommendations.
    1. Depending on the authentication option, you chose in [Step 2. Set up authentication for Defender for Cloud in AWS](#step-2-set-up-authentication-for-defender-for-cloud-in-aws):
        - Select  **Assume Role** and paste the ARN from [Create an IAM role for Defender for Cloud](#create-an-iam-role-for-defender-for-cloud).

            :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-onboard-aws/paste-arn-in-portal.png" alt-text="Pasting the ARN file in the relevant field of the AWS connection wizard in the Azure portal.":::

            OR

        - Select **Credentials** and paste the **access key** and **secret key** from the .csv file you saved in [Create an AWS user for Defender for Cloud](#create-an-aws-user-for-defender-for-cloud).
1. Select **Next**.
1. Configure the options in the **Azure Arc Configuration** tab:

    Defender for Cloud discovers the EC2 instances in the connected AWS account and uses SSM to onboard them to Azure Arc. 

    > [!TIP]
    > For the list of supported operating systems, see [What operating systems for my EC2 instances are supported?](#what-operating-systems-for-my-ec2-instances-are-supported) in the FAQ.

    1. Select the **Resource Group** and **Azure Region** that the discovered AWS EC2s will be onboarded to in the selected subscription.
    1. Enter the **Service Principal ID** and **Service Principal Client Secret** for Azure Arc as described here [Create a Service Principal for onboarding at scale](../azure-arc/servers/onboard-service-principal.md#create-a-service-principal-for-onboarding-at-scale)
    1. If the machine is connecting to the internet via a proxy server, specify the proxy server IP address or the name and port number that the machine uses to communicate with the proxy server. Enter the value in the format ```http://<proxyURL>:<proxyport>```
    1. Select **Review + create**.

        Review the summary information

        The Tags sections will list all Azure Tags that will be automatically created for each onboarded EC2 with its own relevant details to easily recognize it in Azure. 

        Learn more about Azure Tags in [Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy](../azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources.md).

### Step 6. Confirmation

When the connector is successfully created, and AWS Security Hub has been configured properly:

- Defender for Cloud scans the environment for AWS EC2 instances, onboarding them to Azure Arc, enabling to install the Log Analytics agent and providing threat protection and security recommendations. 
- The Defender for Cloud service scans for new AWS EC2 instances every 6 hours and onboards them according to the configuration.
- The AWS CIS standard will be shown in the Defender for Cloud's regulatory compliance dashboard.
- If Security Hub policy is enabled, recommendations will appear in the Defender for Cloud portal and the  regulatory compliance dashboard 5-10 minutes after onboard completes.
