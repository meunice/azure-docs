# Quickstart: Create a mesh network topology with Azure Virtual Network Manager using the Azure portal

Get started with Azure Virtual Network Manager by using the Azure portal to manage connectivity for all your virtual networks.

In this quickstart, you'll deploy three virtual networks and use Azure Virtual Network Manager to create a mesh network topology. Then you'll verify if the connectivity configuration got applied.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Virtual Network Manager is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
