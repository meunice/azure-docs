# How to use Text Analytics for health

[!INCLUDE [service notice](../includes/service-notice.md)]

Text Analytics for health can be used to extract and label relevant medical information from unstructured texts, such as: doctor's notes, discharge summaries, clinical documents, and electronic health records.  There are two ways to utilize this service: 

* The web-based API and client libraries (asynchronous)
* A [Docker container](use-containers.md) (synchronous)

## Features

Text Analytics for health performs Named Entity Recognition (NER), relation extraction, entity negation and entity linking on English-language text to uncover insights in unstructured clinical and biomedical text. 
See the [entity categories](../concepts/health-entity-categories.md) returned by Text Analytics for health for a full list of supported entities. For information on confidence scores, see the [transparency note](/legal/cognitive-services/text-analytics/transparency-note#general-guidelines-to-understand-and-improve-performance?context=/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/context/context). 

> [!TIP]
> If you want to start using this feature, you can follow the [quickstart article](../quickstart.md) to get started. You can also make example requests using [Language Studio](../../language-studio.md) without needing to write code.

## Determine how to process the data (optional)

### Specify the Text Analytics for health model

By default, Text Analytics for health will use the latest available AI model on your text. You can also configure your API requests to use a specific model version. The model you specify will be used to perform operations provided by the Text Analytics for health.

| Supported Versions | latest version |
|--|--|
| `2021-05-15` | `2021-05-15`   |

### Text Analytics for health container

The [Text Analytics for health container](use-containers.md) uses separate model versioning than the REST API and client libraries. Only one model version is available per container image.

| Endpoint                        | Container Image Tag                     | Model version |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|
| `/entities/health`              | `3.0.016230002-onprem-amd64` (latest)            | `2021-05-15`  |
| `/entities/health`              | `3.0.015370001-onprem-amd64`            | `2021-03-01`  |
| `/entities/health`              | `1.1.013530001-amd64-preview`           | `2020-09-03`  |
| `/entities/health`              | `1.1.013150001-amd64-preview`           | `2020-07-24`  |
| `/domains/health`               | `1.1.012640001-amd64-preview`           | `2020-05-08`  |
| `/domains/health`               | `1.1.012420001-amd64-preview`           | `2020-05-08`  |
| `/domains/health`               | `1.1.012070001-amd64-preview`           | `2020-04-16`  |

### Input languages

Currently the Text Analytics for health only [supports](../language-support.md) the English language. 

## Submitting data

To send an API request, You will need your Language resource endpoint and key.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the key and endpoint for your Language resource on the Azure portal. They will be located on the resource's **Key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 

Analysis is performed upon receipt of the request. For information on the size and number of requests you can send per minute and second, see the data limits below.

If you send a request using the REST API or client library, the results will be returned asynchronously. If you're using the Docker container, they will be returned synchronously.  

[!INCLUDE [asynchronous-result-availability](../../includes/async-result-availability.md)]


## Getting results from the feature

Depending on your API request, and the data you submit to the Text Analytics for health, you will get:

[!INCLUDE [Text Analytics for health features](../includes/features.md)]


## Data limits

> [!NOTE]
> * If you need to analyze larger documents than the limit allows, you can break the text into smaller chunks of text before sending them to the API. For best results, split text between sentences.
> * A document is a single string of text characters.  

| Limit | Value |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Maximum size of a single document | 30,720 characters as measured by [StringInfo.LengthInTextElements](/dotnet/api/system.globalization.stringinfo.lengthintextelements). |
| Maximum size of entire request | 1 MB |
| Max Documents Per Request | 10 for the web-based API, 1000 for the container. |

If a document exceeds the character limit, the API won't process a document that exceeds the maximum size, and will return an invalid document error for it. If an API request has multiple documents, the API will continue processing them if they are within the character limit.

When you send a document larger than 5,120 characters, it will be split by Text Analytics for health into chunks of 5,120 characters. If two entities are present on either side of a split that are related, the model will not be able to detect the relation. To prevent potential relations from being undetected, consider splitting your text into documents of 5,120 characters or less, consisting only of full sentences.

### Rate limits

Your rate limit will vary with your [pricing tier](https://aka.ms/unifiedLanguagePricing). These limits are the same for both versions of the API. These rate limits don't apply to the Text Analytics for health container, which does not have a set rate limit.

| Tier          | Requests per second | Requests per minute |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| S / Multi-service | 1000                | 1000                |
| F0         | 100                 | 300                 |
