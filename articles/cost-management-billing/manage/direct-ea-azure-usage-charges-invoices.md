# View your usage summary details and download reports for direct EA enrollments

This article explains how enterprise administrators of direct Enterprise Agreement (EA) enrollments can view a summary of their usage data, Azure Prepayment consumed, and charges associated with other usage in the Azure portal. Charges are presented at the summary level across all accounts and subscriptions of the enrollment.

Check out the [EA admin manage consumption and invoices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO8V9eLfQHY) video. It's part of the [Direct Enterprise Customer Billing Experience in the Azure portal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeZrVF6SXmsoHSnAgrDDzL0W5j8KevFIm) series of videos.

## Prerequisites

To review and verify the charges on your invoice, you must be an Enterprise Administrator. For more information, see [Understand Azure Enterprise Agreement administrative roles in Azure](understand-ea-roles.md). If you don't know who the Enterprise Administrator is for your organization, create a support request in the Azure portal.

## Review usage charges

To view detailed usage for specific accounts, download the usage detail report:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing** and then select it.
1. Select **Billing scopes** from the navigation menu and then select the billing account that you want to work with.
1. In the navigation menu, select **Usage + Charges**.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices/navigation-usage-charges.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Usage + charges page." lightbox="./media/direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices/navigation-usage-charges.png" :::
1. To view details from previous years, select a **Timespan**.

The following table lists the terms and descriptions shown on the Usage + Charges page in the Azure portal. Charges shown in the Azure portal are in USD currency.

| **Term** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Month | The Usage month |
| Charges against Credits | The credit applied during that specific period. |
| Service Overage | Your organization's usage charges exceed your credit balance |
| Billed Separately | The services your organization used aren't covered by the credit. |
| Azure Marketplace | Azure Marketplace purchases and usage aren't covered by your organization's credit and are billed separately |
| Total Charges | Charges against credits + Service Overage + Billed Separately + Azure Marketplace |

## Download usage charges CSV file

Enterprise administrators use the Download Usage + Charges page to download the following reports as CSV files.

- **Usage Details** - Depending on your selection, the CSV file provides all charges (usage and purchases) including RI (reservation) purchases. Or, amortized charges (usage and purchases) including reservation purchases.
- **Marketplace Store Charge** - The Marketplace Store Charge CSV file contains the usage-based Marketplace charges breakdown by day for the specified billing period.
- **Price sheet** - The Price Sheet CSV file contains the applicable rate for each meter for the given Enrollment and Billing Period.
- **Balance and Summary** - The Balance and Summary CSV file contains a monthly summary of information for balances, new purchases, Marketplace service charges, adjustments, and overage charges.

1. Select the **Download** symbol next to the month's report.  
:::image type="content" source="./media/direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices/download-usage-charges-csv.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Download option." :::
1. On the Download Usage + Charges page, select **Prepare document** for the report that you want to download.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices/prepare-document.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Prepare document page." lightbox="./media/direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices/prepare-document.png" :::
1. It could take a while for Azure to prepare your download, depending on your monthly usage. When it's ready for download, select **Download csv**.

Enterprise administrators can also view an overall summary of the charges for the selected Timespan at the bottom of the Usage + charges page.

## Download or view your Azure billing invoice

You can download your invoice from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or have it sent in email. Invoices are sent to whoever is set up to receive invoices for the enrollment.

Only an Enterprise Administrator has permission to view and get the billing invoice. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](manage-billing-access.md).

You receive an Azure invoice when any of the following events occur during your billing cycle:

- **Service overage** - Your organization's usage charges exceed your credit balance.
- **Charges billed separately** - The services your organization used aren't covered by the credit. You're invoiced for the following services despite your credit balance:
  - Canonical
  - Citrix XenApp Essentials
  - Citrix XenDesktop
  - Registered User
  - Openlogic
  - Remote Access Rights XenApp Essentials Registered User
  - Ubuntu Advantage
  - Visual Studio Enterprise (Monthly)
  - Visual Studio Enterprise (Annual)
  - Visual Studio Professional (Monthly)
  - Visual Studio Professional (Annual)
- **Marketplace charges** - Azure Marketplace purchases and usage aren't covered by your organization's credit. So, you're invoiced for Marketplace charges despite your credit balance. In the Azure portal, an Enterprise Administrator can enable and disable Marketplace purchases.

Your invoice displays Azure usage charges with costs associated to them first, followed by any Marketplace charges. If you have a credit balance, it's applied to Azure usage and your invoice will display Azure usage and Marketplace usage without any cost last.

## Review reservation transaction details

You can view all the reservations placed for an Enterprise Agreement in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing** and select it.
1. Select **Billing scopes** from the navigation menu and then select the billing account that you want to work with.
1. In the navigation menu, select **Reservation transactions**. Prices shown in the following image are examples.  
    :::image type="content" source="./media/direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices/reservation-transactions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Reservation transactions page." lightbox="./media/direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices/reservation-transactions.png" :::

The following table lists the terms and descriptions shown on the Reservation transactions page.

| **Term** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Date | Date that the reservation was made |
| Name | Name of the reservation |
| Description | Description of the reservation |

## CSV report formatting issues

When you view CSV reports in Excel and your billing currency is Euros, you might have formatting issues that involve commas and periods.

The costs shown are examples.

For example, you might see:

| **ServiceResource** | **ResourceQtyConsumed** | **ResourceRate** | **ExtendedCost** |
|---|--- | ---|---|
| Hours | 24 | 0,0535960591133005 | 12,863,054,187,192,100,000,000 |

However, you *should* see:

| **ServiceResource** | **ResourceQtyConsumed** | **ResourceRate** | **ExtendedCost** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hours | 24 | 0,0535960591133005 | 1,2863054187192120000000 |

The formatting issue occurs because of default settings in Excel's import functionality. Excel imports all fields as *General* text and assumes that a number is separated in the mathematical standard. For example: *1,000.00*.

If your currency uses a period (**.**) for the thousandth place separator and a comma (**,**) for the decimal place separator, it will display incorrectly. For example: *1.000,00*. The import results may vary depending on your regional language setting.

To import the CSV file without formatting issues:

1. In Microsoft Excel, go to **File** > **Open**. The Text Import Wizard appears.
1. Under **Original Data Type**, choose **delimited**. Default is **Fixed Width**.
1. Select **Next**.
1. Under **Delimiters**, select the box for **Comma**. Clear **Tab** if it's selected.
1. Select **Next**.
1. Scroll over to the **ResourceRate** and **ExtendedCost** columns.
1. Select the **ResourceRate** column. It appears highlighted in black.
1. Under the **Column Data Format** section, select **Text** instead of **General**. The column header will change from **General** to **Text**.
1. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the **Extended Cost** column, and then select **Finish**.

> [!TIP]
> If you have set CSV files to automatically open in Excel, you must use the **Open** function in Excel instead. In Excel, go to **File** > **Open**.
