* Clone the [AVA C# sample repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/video-analyzer-iot-edge-csharp)
* Follow the instructions in the [README in the **src/video-player** folder](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/video-analyzer-iot-edge-csharp/blob/main/src/video-player/README.md)

## Get Started
After following the README instructions and the app is running on http://localhost:3000/

## Zone Drawer
The Zone Drawer allows you to create zones by drawing polygons and drawing lines on your video. You can also save these zones and lines to receive the coordinates of your respective zones and lines.  
  
**Example:**
```json
  {
    "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.NamedLineString",
    "name": "Line 1",
    "line": [
      {
        "x": 0.6987951807228916,
        "y": 0.4430992736077482
      },
      {
        "x": 0.6987951807228916,
        "y": 0.7046004842615012
      }
    ]
  }{
    "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.NamedPolygonString",
    "name": "Zone 2",
    "polygon": [
      {
        "x": 0.10575635876840696,
        "y": 0.7481840193704601
      },
      {
        "x": 0.16599732262382866,
        "y": 0.7796610169491526
      },
      {
        "x": 0.07764390896921017,
        "y": 0.9007263922518159
      },
      {
        "x": 0.024096385542168676,
        "y": 0.8547215496368039
      }
    ]
  }
```
Copying these coordinates can be done using the **Copy to clipboard** button. Zones and lines can be renamed and deleted using the three dots next to each zone and line.

You can select any of your generated clips from drop-down list, where each clip is titled as the start and end dates and times.
(Example: Format)
