# Access policies

Access policies define the permissions and duration of access to a given Video Analyzer video resource. These access policies allow for greater control and flexibility by allowing 3rd party (Non AAD Clients) JWT tokens to provide authorization to client APIâ€™s that enable: 

- access to Video Metadata. 
- access to Video streaming. 

## Access Policy definition

```json
"name": "accesspolicyname1", 
"properties": { 
    "role": "Reader", 
    "authentication": { 
        "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.JwtAuthentication", 
        "issuers": [ 
            "issuer1", 
            "issuer2" 
        ], 
        "audiences": [ 
            "audience1" 
        ], 
        "claims": [ 
            { 
                "name":"claimname1", 
                "value":"claimvalue1" 
            }, 
            { 
                "name":"claimname2", 
                "value":"claimvalue2" 
            } 
        ], 
        "keys": [ 
            { 
                "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.RsaTokenKey", 
                "alg": "RS256", 
                "kid": "123", 
                "n": "YmFzZTY0IQ==", 
                "e": "ZLFzZTY0IQ==" 
            }, 
            { 
                "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.EccTokenKey", 
                "alg": "ES256", 
                "kid": "124", 
                "x": "XX==", 
                "y": "YY==" 
            } 
        ] 
    } 
} 
```

> [!NOTE] 
> Only one key type is required. 

### Roles

Currently only reader role is supported.

### Issuer Matching Rules

Multiple issues can be specified in the policy, single issuer can be specified in the token.  Issuer matches if the token issuer is among the issuers specified in the policy.

### Audience Matching Rules

If the audience value is ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} for the video resource, then the audience that is provided in the JWT token must match the base resource URL. If not, then the token audience must match the audience from the access policy.

### Claims Matching Rules

Multiple claims can be specified in the access policy and in the JWT token.  All the claims form an access policy must be provided in the token to pass validation, however, the JWT token can have additional claims that are not listed in the access policy.

### Keys

Two types of keys are supported these are the RSA and the ECC types.

[RSA](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))

* @type- \#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.RsaTokenKey
* alg - Algorithm.  Can be 256, 384 or 512 
* kid - Key ID
* n - Modulus
* e - Public Exponent 

[ECC](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)        

* @type- \#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.EccTokenKey
* alg - Algorithm.  Can be 256, 384 or 512
* kid - Key ID
* x - Coordinate value.
* y - Coordinate value.

### Token validation Process

Customers must create their own JWT tokens and will be validated using the following method:

- From the list of policies that match the Key ID we validate:
  - Token signature
  - Token expiration
  - Issuer
  - Audience
  - Additional claims

### Policy Audience and Token Matching Examples:

| **Policy Audience**                      | Requested URL                         | Token URL                            | Result |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------ |
| (Any literal)                            | (ANY)                                 | (Match)                              | Grant  |
| (Any Literal)                            | (ANY)                                 | (Not Match)                          | Deny   |
| ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} | https://fqdn/videos                   | https://fqdn/videos/*                | Grant  |
| ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} | https://fqdn/videos                   | https://fqdn/videos/{videoName}      | Deny   |
| ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} | https://fqdn/videos/{videoName}       | https://fqdn/vid*                    | Grant  |
| ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} | https://fqdn/videos/{videoName}       | https://fqdn/videos/*                | Grant  |
| ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} | https://fqdn/videos/{videoName}       | https://fqdn/videos/{baseVideoName}* | Grant  |
| ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} | https://fqdn/videos/{videoName}       | https://fqdn/videos/{videoName}      | Grant  |
| ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} | https://fqdn/videos/{videoName}Suffix | https://fqdn/videos/{videoName}      | Deny   |
| ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} | https://fqdn/videos/{otherVideoName}  | https://fqdn/videos/{videoName}      | Deny   |

> [!NOTE]  
> Video Analyzer supports a maximum of 20 policies.  ${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern} allows for greater flexibility to access specific resources by using one access policy and multiple tokens.  These tokens then allow access to different Video Analyzer resources based on the audience. 

## Creating a token

In this section, we will create a JWT token that we will use later in the article.  We will use a sample application that will generate the JWT token and provide you with all the fields required to create the access policy.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you are familiar with how to generate a JWT token based on either an RSA or ECC certificate, you can skip this section.

1. Clone the [AVA C# samples repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/video-analyzer-iot-edge-csharp). Then, go to the JWTTokenIssuer application folder *src/jwt-token-issuer* and find the JWTTokenIssuer application.
2. Open Visual Studio Code, and then go to the folder where you downloaded the JWTTokenIssuer application. This folder should contain the *\*.csproj* file.
3. In the explorer pane, go to the *program.cs* file.
4. On line 77, change the audience to your Video Analyzer endpoint, followed by /videos/\*, so it looks like:

   ```
   https://{Azure Video Analyzer Account ID}.api.{Azure Long Region Code}.videoanalyzer.azure.net/videos/*
   ```

   > [!NOTE] 
   > The Video Analyzer endpoint can be found in overview section of the Video Analyzer resource in the Azure portal.

   :::image type="content" source="media/player-widget/client-api-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the player widget endpoint.":::
    
5. On line 78, change the issuer to the issuer value of your certificate. Example: `https://contoso.com`
6. Save the file.    

   > [!NOTE]
   > You might be prompted with the message `Required assets to build and debug are missing from 'jwt token issuer'. Add them?` Select `Yes`.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/player-widget/visual-studio-code-required-assets.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the required asset prompt in Visual Studio Code.":::
   
7. Open a Command Prompt window and go to the folder with the JWTTokenIssuer files. Run the following two commands: `dotnet build`, followed by `dotnet run`. If you have the C# extension on Visual Studio Code, you also can select F5 to run the JWTTokenIssuer application.

The application builds and then executes. After it builds, it creates a self-signed certificate and generates the JWT token information from that certificate. You also can run the JWTTokenIssuer.exe file that's located in the debug folder of the directory where the JWTTokenIssuer built from. The advantage of running the application is that you can specify input options as follows:

- `JwtTokenIssuer [--audience=<audience>] [--issuer=<issuer>] [--expiration=<expiration>] [--certificatePath=<filepath> --certificatePassword=<password>]`

JWTTokenIssuer creates the JWT token and the following needed components:

- `Issuer`, `Audience`, `Key Type`, `Algorithm`, `Key Id`, `RSA Key Modulus`, `RSA Key Exponent`, `Token`

Be sure to copy these values for later use.


## Creating an Access Policy

There are two ways to create an access policy.

### In the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and go to your resource group where your Video Analyzer account is located.
1. Select the Video Analyzer resource.
1. Under **Video Analyzer**, select **Access Policies**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/player-widget/portal-access-policies.png" alt-text="Player widget - portal access policies.":::
   
1. Select **New** and enter the following information:

   > [!NOTE] 
   > These values come from the JWTTokenIssuer application created in the previous step.

   - Access policy name - any name

   - Issuer - must match the JWT Token Issuer 

   - Audience - Audience for the JWT Token -- `${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern}` is the default.

   - Key Type - RSA 

   - Algorithm - supported values are RS256, RS384, RS512

   - Key ID - generated from your certificate. For more information, see [Create a token](#creating-a-token).

   - RSA Key Modulus - generated from your certificate. For more information, see [Create a token](#creating-a-token).

   - RSA Key Exponent - generated from your certificate. For more information, see [Create a token](#creating-a-token).
