# Understand Azure NetApp Files backup

Azure NetApp Files backup expands the data protection capabilities of Azure NetApp Files by providing fully managed backup solution for long-term recovery, archive, and compliance. Backups created by the service are stored in Azure storage, independent of volume snapshots that are available for near-term recovery or cloning. Backups taken by the service can be restored to new Azure NetApp Files volumes within the region. Azure NetApp Files backup supports both policy-based (scheduled) backups and manual (on-demand) backups. For additional information, see [How Azure NetApp Files snapshots work](snapshots-introduction.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure NetApp Files backup feature is currently in preview. You need to submit a waitlist request for accessing the feature through the **[Azure NetApp Files Backup Public Preview](https://aka.ms/anfbackuppreviewsignup)** page. Wait for an official confirmation email from the Azure NetApp Files team before using the Azure NetApp Files backup feature.

* West US 
* South Central
* West US 2
* North Europe 
* West Europe

* Japan East

## Cost model for Azure NetApp Files backup

Pricing for Azure NetApp Files backup is based on the total amount of storage consumed by the backup. There are no setup charges or minimum usage fees. 
Backup restore is priced based on the total amount of backup capacity restored during the billing cycle.

As a pricing example, assume the following situations:

* Your source volume is from the Azure NetApp Files Premium service level. It has a volume quota size of 1000 GiB and a volume consumed size of 500 GiB at the beginning of the first day of a month. The volume is in the US South Central region.
* Youâ€™ve configured a daily *snapshot* policy with 5 local snapshots to keep, and a daily *backup* policy to keep 30 backup copies.
* For simplicity, assume your source volume has a constant 1% data change every day, but the total volume consumed size does not grow (remains at 500 GiB).

When the backup policy is assigned to the volume, the baseline backup to service-managed Azure storage is initiated. When the backup is complete, the baseline backup of 500 GiB will be added to the backup list of the volume. After the baseline transfer, daily backups only back up changed blocks. Assume 5-GiB daily incremental backups added, the total backup storage consumed would be `500GiB + 30*5GiB = 650GiB`.

You will be billed at the end of month for backup at the rate of $0.05 per month for the total amount of storage consumed by the backup.  That is, 650 GiB with a total monthly backup charge of `650*$0.05=$32.5`. Regular Azure NetApp Files storage capacity applies to local snapshots. See the [Azure NetApp Files Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/netapp/) page for more information.

If you choose to restore a backup of, for example, 600 GiB to a new volume, you will be charged at the rate of $0.02 per GiB of backup capacity restores. In this case, it will be `600*$0.02 = $12` for the restore operation.
