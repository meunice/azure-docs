# Restore a backup to a new volume

Restoring a backup creates a new volume with the same protocol type. This article explains the restore operation. 

## Considerations

* The new volume created by the restore operation cannot be mounted until the restore completes. 

* You should trigger the restore operation when there are no baseline backups. Otherwise, the restore might increase the load on the Azure Blob account where your data is backed up. 

## Steps

1. Select **Volumes**. Navigate to **Backups**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a volume is deleted but the backup policy wasn’t disabled before the volume deletion, all the backups related to the volume are retained in the Azure storage, and you can find them under the associated NetApp account.  See [Search backups at NetApp account level](backup-search.md#search-backups-at-netapp-account-level).


2. From the backup list, select the backup to restore. Click the three dots (`…`) to the right of the backup, then click **Restore to new volume** from the Action menu.

3. In the Create a Volume page that appears, provide information for the fields in the page as applicable, and click **Review + Create** to begin restoring the backup to a new volume.   

    * The **Protocol** field is pre-populated from the original volume and cannot be changed.    
        However, if you restore a volume from the backup list at the NetApp account level, you need to specify the Protocol field. The Protocol field must match the protocol of the original volume. Otherwise, the restore operation will fail with the following error:  
        `Protocol Type value mismatch between input and source volume of backupId <backup-id of the selected backup>. Supported protocol type : <Protocol Type of the source volume>`

    * The **Quota** value must be greater than or equal to the size of the backup from which the restore is triggered (minimum 100 GiB).

    * The **Capacity pool** that the backup is restored into must have sufficient unused capacity to host the new restored volume. Otherwise, the restore operation will fail.
