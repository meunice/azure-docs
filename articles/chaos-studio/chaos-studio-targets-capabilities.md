# Targets and capabilities in Azure Chaos Studio

Before you can inject a fault against an Azure resource, the resource must first have corresponding targets and capabilities enabled. Targets and capabilities control which resources are enabled for fault injection and which faults can run against those resources. Using targets and capabilities [along with other security measures](chaos-studio-permissions-security.md) you can avoid accidental or malicious fault injection with Chaos Studio. For example, with targets and capabilities you can allow the CPU pressure fault to run against your production virtual machines while preventing the kill process fault from running against them.

## Targets

A chaos **target** enables Chaos Studio to interact with a resource for a particular target type. A **target type** represents the method of injecting faults against a resource. Resource types that only support service-direct faults have one target type, for example the `Microsoft-CosmosDB` type for Azure Cosmos DB. Resource types that support service-direct and agent-based faults have two target types: one for the service-direct faults (for example, `Microsoft-VirtualMachine`), and one for the agent-based faults (always `Microsoft-Agent`).

A target is an extension resource created as a child of the resource that is being onboarded to Chaos Studio (for example, a Virtual Machine or Network Security Group). A target defines the target type that is enabled on the resource. For example, if onboarding a Cosmos DB instance with this resource ID:

```
/subscriptions/fd9ccc83-faf6-4121-9aff-2a2d685ca2a2/resourceGroups/chaosstudiodemo/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/myDB
```

The Cosmos DB resource will have a child resource formatted like this:

```
/subscriptions/fd9ccc83-faf6-4121-9aff-2a2d685ca2a2/resourceGroups/chaosstudiodemo/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/myDB/providers/Microsoft.Chaos/targets/Microsoft-CosmosDB
```

Only resources with a target created off of them are targetable for fault injection with Chaos Studio.

## Capabilities

A **capability** enables Chaos Studio to run a particular fault against a resource, such a shutting down a virtual machine. Capabilities are unique per target type and represent the fault that they enable, for example, `CPUPressure-1.0`. [Visit the Chaos Studio fault library](chaos-studio-fault-library.md) to understand all available faults and their corresponding capability names and target types.

A capability is an extension resource created as a child of a target. For example, if enabling the shutdown fault on a Virtual Machine with a service-direct target ID:

```
/subscriptions/fd9ccc83-faf6-4121-9aff-2a2d685ca2a2/resourceGroups/myRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM/providers/Microsoft.Chaos/targets/Microsoft-VirtualMachine
```

The target resource will have a child resource formatted like this:

```
/subscriptions/fd9ccc83-faf6-4121-9aff-2a2d685ca2a2/resourceGroups/myRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM/providers/Microsoft.Chaos/targets/Microsoft-VirtualMachine/capabilities/shutdown-1.0
```

An experiment can only inject faults on onboarded targets with the corresponding capabilities enabled. 

## Listing capability names and parameters
For reference, a list of capability names, fault URNs, and parameters is available [in our fault library](chaos-studio-fault-library.md), but you can use the HTTP response to creating a capability or do a GET on an existing capability to get this information on demand. For example, doing a GET on a VM shutdown capability:

```bash
az rest --method get --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/fd9ccc83-faf6-4121-9aff-2a2d685ca2a2/resourceGroups/myRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM/providers/Microsoft.Chaos/targets/Microsoft-VirtualMachine/capabilities/shutdown-1.0?api-version=2021-08-11-preview"
```

Will return the following JSON:

```JSON
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/fd9ccc83-faf6-4121-9aff-2a2d685ca2a2/myRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM/providers/Microsoft.Chaos/targets/Microsoft-VirtualMachine/capabilities/shutdown-1.0",
  "name": "shutdown-1.0",
  "properties": {
    "description": null,
    "name": "shutdown-1.0",
    "parametersSchema": "https://schema-tc.eastus.chaos-prod.azure.com/targetTypes/Microsoft-VirtualMachine/capabilityTypes/Shutdown-1.0/parametersSchema.json",
    "publisher": "Microsoft",
    "targetType": "VirtualMachine",
    "type": "shutdown",
    "urn": "urn:csci:microsoft:virtualMachine:shutdown/1.0",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "resourceGroup": "myRG",
  "systemData": {
    "createdAt": "2021-09-15T23:00:00.826575+00:00",
    "lastModifiedAt": "2021-09-15T23:00:00.826575+00:00"
  },
  "type": "Microsoft.Chaos/targets/capabilities"
}
```

The `properties.urn` property is used to define the fault you want to run in a chaos experiment. To understand the schema for this fault's parameters, you can GET the schema referenced by `properties.parametersSchema`.

```bash
az rest --method get --url "https://schema-tc.eastus.chaos-prod.azure.com/targetTypes/Microsoft-VirtualMachine/capabilityTypes/Shutdown-1.0/parametersSchema.json"
```

returns the following JSON:
```JSON
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
  "properties": {
    "abruptShutdown": {
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    "restartWhenComplete": {
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "type": "object"
}
```

- [Create and run your first experiment](chaos-studio-tutorial-service-direct-portal.md)
