## Release date: 12/27/2021

This release applies for HDInsight 4.0. HDInsight release is made available to all regions over several days. The release date here indicates the first region release date. If you don't see below changes, wait for the release being live in your region over several days.

The OS versions for this release are:
- HDInsight 4.0: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS

HDInsight 4.0 image has been updated to mitigate Log4j vulnerability as described in [Microsoftâ€™s Response to CVE-2021-44228 Apache Log4j 2.](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/12/11/microsofts-response-to-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2/)

> [!Note]
> * Any HDI 4.0 clusters created post 27 Dec 2021 00:00 UTC are created with an updated version of the image which mitigates the log4j vulnerabilities. Hence, customers need not patch/reboot these clusters.
> * For new HDInsight 4.0 clusters created between 16 Dec 2021 at 01:15 UTC and 27 Dec 2021 00:00 UTC, HDInsight 3.6 or in pinned subscriptions after 16 Dec 2021 the patch is auto applied within the hour in which the cluster is created, however customers must then reboot their nodes for the patching to complete (except for Kafka Management nodes, which are automatically rebooted).
