# Set up an Azure Digital Twins instance

This article will walk you through the basic steps to set up a new Azure Digital Twins instance. This includes creating the instance, and assigning [Azure Active Directory (AAD)](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) permissions to the instance for yourself.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [Cloud Shell for Azure Digital Twins](../../includes/digital-twins-cloud-shell.md)]

## Set up an Azure Digital Twins instance

Next, you will create a new Azure resource group for use in this how-to. Then, you can **create a new instance of Azure Digital Twins** inside that resource group. 

You'll also need to provide a name for your instance and choose a region for the deployment. To see what regions support Azure Digital Twins, visit [Azure products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=digital-twins).

>[!NOTE]
> The name of the new instance must be unique within the region (meaning that if another Azure Digital Twins instance in that region is already using the name you choose, you'll have to pick a different name).

Create the resource group and the instance with the following commands:

```azurecli
az group create --location <region> --name <name-for-your-resource-group>
az dt create --dt-name <name-for-your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> -g <your-resource-group> -l <region>
```

The result of these commands looks something like this, outputting information about the resources you've created:

Note the Azure Digital Twins instance's *hostName*, *name*, and *resourceGroup* from the output. These are all key values that you may need as you continue working with your Azure Digital Twins instance, to set up authentication and related Azure resources.

> [!TIP]
> You can see these properties, along with all the properties of your instance, at any time by running `az dt show --dt-name <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance>`.

### Assign Azure Active Directory permissions

Azure Digital Twins uses [Azure Active Directory (AAD)](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) for role-based access control (RBAC). This means that before you can make data plane calls to your Azure Digital Twins instance, you must first assign yourself a role with these permissions.

In order to use Azure Digital Twins with a client application, you'll also need to make sure your client app can authenticate against Azure Digital Twins. This is done by setting up an Azure Active Directory (AAD) app registration, which you can read about in [How-to: Authenticate a client application](how-to-authenticate-client.md).

#### Assign yourself a role

Create a role assignment for yourself in the Azure Digital Twins instance, using your email associated with the AAD tenant on your Azure subscription. 

To be able to do this, you need to be classified as an owner in your Azure subscription. You can check this by running the `az role assignment list --assignee <your-Azure-email>` command, and verifying in the output that the *roleDefinitionName* value is *Owner*. If you find that the value is *Contributor* or something other than *Owner*, please contact your subscription administrator with the power to grant permissions in your subscription. They can either elevate your role on the entire subscription so that you can run the following command, or an owner can run the following command on your behalf to set up your Azure Digital Twins permissions for you.

To assign your user "owner" permissions in your Azure Digital Twins instance, use the following command (must be run by an owner of the Azure subscription):

```azurecli
az dt role-assignment create --dt-name <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --assignee "<your-AAD-email>" --role "Azure Digital Twins Owner (Preview)"
```

The result of this command is outputted information about the role assignment that's been created.

> [!TIP]
> If you get a *400: BadRequest* error instead, run the following command to get the *ObjectID* for your user:
> ```azurecli
> az ad user show --id <your-AAD-email> --query objectId
> ```
> Then, repeat the role assignment command using your user's *Object ID* in place of your email.

You now have an Azure Digital Twins instance ready to go, and permissions to manage it.
