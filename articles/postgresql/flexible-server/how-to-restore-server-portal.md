# Point-in-time restore of a Flexible Server



This article provides step-by-step procedure to perform point-in-time recoveries in flexible server using backups. You can perform either to a latest restore point or a custom restore point within your retention period.

## Pre-requisites

To complete this how-to guide, you need:

-   You must have an Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server. The same procedure is also applicable for flexible server configured with zone redundancy.

## Restoring to the latest restore point

Follow these steps to restore your flexible server using an existing backup.

1.  In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), choose your flexible server that you want to restore the backup from.

2.  Click **Overview** from the left panel and click **Restore**

6.  A notification will be shown that the restore operation has been initiated.

## Restoring to a custom restore point

Follow these steps to restore your flexible server using an existing backup.

1.  In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), choose your flexible server that you want to restore the backup from.

2.  From the overview page, click **Restore**.

6.  Click **OK**.

7.  A notification will be shown that the restore operation has been initiated.

## Performing Geo-Restore (Preview)

If your source server is configured with geo-redundant backup, you can restore the servers in a paired region. Please note that, for the first time restore, please wait at least 1 hour after the source server is created.

1.  In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), choose your flexible server that you want to geo-restore the backup from.

2.  From the overview page, click **Restore**.

3. From the restore page, choose Geo-Redundant restore to restore to a paired region.

4. The region and the database versions are pre-selected. It will be restored to the last available data at the paired region. You can choose the **Availability zone** in the region to restore to.

5. By default, the backups for the restored server are configured with Geo-redundant backup. If you do not want geo-redundant backup, you can click **Configure Server** and uncheck the Geo-redundant backup.

6. If the source server is configured with **private access**, you can only restore to another VNET in the remote region. You can either choose an existing VNET or create a new VNET and restore your server into that VNET.
