# Azure Maps QPS rate limits

Below are the QPS usage limits for each Azure Maps service by Pricing Tier.

When QPS limits are reached, an HTTP 429 error will be returned. If you are using the Gen 2 or Gen 1 S1 pricing tiers, you can create an Azure Maps *Technical* Support Request in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) to increase a specific QPS limit if needed. QPS limits for the Gen 1 S0 pricing tier cannot be increased.
