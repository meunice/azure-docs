# Enterprise IoT network protection

The Microsoft Defender for IoT team is responsible for securing IoT, and Operational Technology (OT) devices end-to-end whether they are connected to IT, OT, or dedicated IoT networks.  

The enterprise IoT network protection extends the agentless capabilities to go beyond operational environments, and advance into the enterprise environments. This protection provides coverage for the entire breadth of IoT devices in your environment including corporate printers, cameras, to purpose-built devices, proprietary, and unique devices.

The expansion into the enterprise network, creates a unique opportunity to apply Microsoft 365 Defender’s asset discovery capabilities.

## Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration

Microsoft Defender for IoT can now integrate with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This integration combines Microsoft Defender for Endpoint’s device discovery capabilities, with the agentless monitoring capabilities to secure enterprise IoT devices connected to an IT network (for example, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), printers, and smart TVs). The integration allows organizations to take advantage of a single integrated solution that secures all of their IoT, and OT infrastructure.

Microsoft Defender for IoT's sensors can now be used an additional data source providing visibility in area's of your organizations network where Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is not deployed and when employees are accessing information remotely. Microsoft Defender for IoT's sensors provide visibility into the IoT to IoT and the IoT to internet communications.

Once this integration has been enabled, any devices discovered on the network by either Defender for Iot, or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will be synced automatically across both portals.

To learn how to integrate Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with your Microsoft Defender for IoT solution, see Microsoft Defender for Endpoint documentation.

## Automatic discovery for IT, IoT, and OT

Use passive agentless network monitoring to gain insight into your complete inventory of all your IT, IoT, and OT devices. The discovery process continuously identifies and classifies devices in your network, and resolves all device details. The discovery process is performed with zero impact to the network.  

## Single pane of glass

A centralized user experience lets the security team visualize, and secure all their IT, IoT, and OT devices regardless of where the devices are located.

## The power of unified SIEM and XDR  

Microsoft Defender for IoT shares its high-resolution signal data with Microsoft Defender 365, and Microsoft Sentinel, to accelerate incident response and provide a bird's eye view across IT/OT/IoT boundaries, Microsoft Defender for IoT shares rich telemetry data seamlessly with Microsoft’s SIEM and XDR platforms—Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender—and interoperates with other SOC tools such as Splunk, IBM QRadar, and ServiceNow. Azure Sentinel customers no longer need to switch consoles to put the story together!  

## Easy deployment for a scalable solution

Microsoft Defender for IoT ensures a quick, and frictionless deployment of network sensor  (physical, or virtual) appliances, Support is offered all of our teams if needed. Reach out to our customer support team with any issues.
