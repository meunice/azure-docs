# Availability zone support for App Service Environment

You can deploy App Service Environment across [availability zones](../../availability-zones/az-overview.md). This architecture is also known as zone redundancy. When you configure to be zone redundant, the platform automatically spreads the instances of the Azure App Service plan across all three zones in the selected region. If you specify a capacity larger than three, and the number of instances is divisible by three, the instances are spread evenly. Otherwise, instance counts beyond 3*N are spread across the remaining one or two zones.

> This article is about App Service Environment v3, which is used with isolated v2 App Service plans.

You configure zone redundancy when you create your App Service Environment, and all App Service plans created in that App Service Environment will be zone redundant. You can only specify zone redundancy when you're creating a new App Service Environment. Zone redundancy is only supported in a [subset of regions](./overview.md#regions).

When a zone goes down, the App Service platform detects lost instances and automatically attempts to find new, replacement instances. If you also have autoscale configured, and if it determines that more instances are needed, autoscale also issues a request to App Service to add more instances. Autoscale behavior is independent of App Service platform behavior.

There's no guarantee that requests for instances in a zone-down scenario will succeed, because back-filling lost instances occurs on a best effort basis. It's a good idea to scale your App Service plans to account for losing a zone.

Applications deployed in a zone redundant App Service Environment continue to run and serve traffic, even if other zones in the same region suffer an outage. It's possible, however, that non-runtime behaviors might still be affected by an outage in other availability zones. These behaviors might include the following: App Service plan scaling, application creation, application configuration, and application publishing. Zone redundancy for App Service Environment only ensures continued uptime for deployed applications.

When the App Service platform allocates instances to a zone redundant App Service plan, it uses [best effort zone balancing offered by the underlying Azure virtual machine scale sets](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones.md#zone-balancing). An App Service plan is considered balanced if each zone has either the same number of instances, or +/- 1 instance in all of the other zones used by the App Service plan.

## Pricing

 There is a minimum charge of nine App Service plan instances in a zone redundant App Service Environment. There is no added charge for availability zone support if you have nine or more instances. If you have fewer than nine instances (of any size) across App Service plans in the zone redundant App Service Environment, you're charged for the difference between nine and the running instance count. This charge is for additional Windows I1v2 instances.
