# Virtual Network NAT gateway integration

NAT gateway is a fully managed, highly resilient service, which can be associated with one or more subnets and ensures that all outbound Internet-facing traffic will be routed through the gateway. With App Service, there are two important scenarios that you can use NAT gateway for. 

The NAT gateway gives you a static predictable public IP for outbound Internet-facing traffic. It also significantly increases the available [SNAT ports](../troubleshoot-intermittent-outbound-connection-errors.md) in scenarios where you have a high number of concurrent connections to the same public address/port combination.

For more information and pricing. Go to the [NAT gateway overview](../../virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-overview.md).

> [!Note] 
> Using NAT gateway with App Service is dependent on regional VNet Integration, and therefore **Standard**, **Premium**, **PremiumV2** or **PremiumV3** App Service plan is required.

## Configuring NAT gateway integration

To configure NAT gateway integration with App Service, you need to complete the following steps:

* Configure regional VNet Integration with your app as described in [Integrate your app with an Azure virtual network](../overview-vnet-integration.md)
* Ensure [Route All](../overview-vnet-integration.md#routes) is enabled for your VNet Integration so the Internet bound traffic will be affected by routes in your VNet.
* Provision a NAT gateway with a public IP and associate it with the VNet Integration subnet.

Set up NAT gateway through the portal:

1. Go to the **Networking** UI in the App Service portal and select VNet Integration in the Outbound Traffic section. Ensure that your app is integrated with a subnet and **Route All** has been enabled.
:::image type="content" source="./media/nat-gateway-integration/nat-gateway-route-all-enabled.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Route All enabled for VNet Integration.":::
1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**. The **New** window appears.
1. Search for "NAT gateway" and select it from the list of results.
1. Fill in the **Basics** information and pick the region where your app is located.

1. In the **Outbound IP** tab, create a new or select an existing public IP.

1. In the **Subnet** tab, select the subnet used for VNet Integration.
:::image type="content" source="./media/nat-gateway-integration/nat-gateway-create-subnet.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Subnet tab in Create NAT gateway.":::
1. Fill in tags if needed and **Create** the NAT gateway. After the NAT gateway is provisioned, click on the **Go to resource group** and select the new NAT gateway. You can to see the public IP that your app will use for outbound Internet-facing traffic in the Outbound IP blade.

If you prefer using CLI to configure your environment, these are the important commands. As a prerequisite, you should create a Web App with VNet Integration configured.

Ensure **Route All** is configured for your VNet Integration (*Note*: minimum `az version` required is 2.27):

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config set --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name [myWebApp] --vnet-route-all-enabled
```

Create Public IP and NAT gateway:

```azurecli-interactive
az network public-ip create --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name myPublicIP --sku standard --allocation static

az network nat gateway create --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --name myNATgateway --public-ip-addresses myPublicIP --idle-timeout 10
```

Associate the NAT gateway with the VNet Integration subnet:

```azurecli-interactive
az network vnet subnet update --resource-group [myResourceGroup] --vnet-name [myVnet] --name [myIntegrationSubnet] --nat-gateway myNATgateway
```

## Scaling NAT gateway

The same NAT gateway can be used across multiple subnets in the same Virtual Network allowing a NAT gateway to be used across multiple apps and App Service plans.

NAT gateway supports both public IP addresses and public IP prefixes. A NAT gateway can support up to 16 IP addresses across individual IP addresses and prefixes. Each IP address allocates 64,000 ports (SNAT ports) allowing up to 1M available ports. Learn more in the [Scaling section](../../virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-gateway-resource.md#scale-nat) of NAT gateway.
