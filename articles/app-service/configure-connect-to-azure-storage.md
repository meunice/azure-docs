# Mount Azure Storage as a local share in a custom container in App Service

::: zone pivot="container-windows"

This guide shows how to mount Azure Storage Files as a network share in a Windows container in App Service. Only [Azure Files Shares](../storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-portal.md) and [Premium Files Shares](../storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share.md) are supported. The benefits of custom-mounted storage include:

- Configure persistent storage for your App Service app and manage the storage separately.
- Make static content like video and images readily available for your App Service app. 
- Write application log files or archive older application log to Azure File shares.  
- Share content across multiple apps or with other Azure services.
- Mount Azure Storage in a Windows container in a Standard tier or higher plan, including Isolated ([App Service environment v3](environment/overview.md)).

The following features are supported for Windows containers:

- Secured access to storage accounts with [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) and [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) (when [VNET integration](./overview-vnet-integration.md) is used).
- Azure Files (read/write).
- Up to five mount points per app.
- Drive letter assignments (`C:` to `Z:`).

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

This guide shows how to mount Azure Storage as a network share in a built-in Linux container or a custom Linux container in App Service. See the video [how to mount Azure Storage as a local share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJkvpWYr57Y). The benefits of custom-mounted storage include:

- Configure persistent storage for your App Service app and manage the storage separately.
- Make static content like video and images readily available for your App Service app. 
- Write application log files or archive older application log to Azure File shares.  
- Share content across multiple apps or with other Azure services.

The following features are supported for Linux containers:

- Secured access to storage accounts with [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) and [private links](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) (when [VNET integration](./overview-vnet-integration.md) is used).
- Azure Files (read/write).
- Azure Blobs (read-only).
- Up to five mount points per app.

## Limitations

::: zone pivot="container-windows"

- Storage mounts are not supported for native Windows (non-containerized) apps.
- Azure blobs are not supported.
- [Storage firewall](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md) is supported only through [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) and [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) (when [VNET integration](./overview-vnet-integration.md) is used).
- FTP/FTPS access to mounted storage not supported (use [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)).
- Mapping `[C-Z]:\`, `[C-Z]:\home`, `/`, and `/home` to custom-mounted storage is not supported.
- Storage mounts cannot be used together with clone settings option during [deployment slot](deploy-staging-slots.md) creation.
- Storage mounts are not backed up when you [back up your app](manage-backup.md). Be sure to follow best practices to back up the Azure Storage accounts. 

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

- [Storage firewall](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md) is supported only through [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) and [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) (when [VNET integration](./overview-vnet-integration.md) is used). Custom DNS support is currently unavailable when the mounted Azure Storage account uses a private endpoint.
- FTP/FTPS access to custom-mounted storage is not supported (use [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)).
- Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and Azure SDK support is in preview.
- Mapping `/` or `/home` to custom-mounted storage is not supported.
- Don't map the custom storage mount to `/tmp` or its subdirectories as this may cause timeout during app startup.
- Storage mounts cannot be used together with clone settings option during [deployment slot](deploy-staging-slots.md) creation.
- Storage mounts are not backed up when you [back up your app](manage-backup.md). Be sure to follow best practices to back up the Azure Storage accounts.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the app.
1. From the left navigation, click **Configuration** > **Path Mappings** > **New Azure Storage Mount**. 
1. Configure the storage mount according to the following table. When finished, click **OK**.

    ::: zone pivot="container-windows"
    | Setting | Description |
    |-|-|
    | **Name** | Name of the mount configuration. Spaces are not allowed. |
    | **Configuration options** | Select **Basic** if the storage account is not using [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md). Otherwise, select **Advanced**. |
    | **Storage accounts** | Azure Storage account. It must contain an Azure Files share. |
    | **Share name** | Files share to mount. |
    | **Access key** (Advanced only) | [Access key](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage.md) for your storage account. |
    | **Mount path** | Directory inside the Windows container to mount to Azure Storage. Do not use a root directory (`[C-Z]:\` or `/`) or the `home` directory (`[C-Z]:\home`, or `/home`).|
    ::: zone-end
    ::: zone pivot="container-linux"
    | Setting | Description |
    |-|-|
    | **Name** | Name of the mount configuration. Spaces are not allowed. |
    | **Configuration options** | Select **Basic** if the storage account is not using [service endpoints](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network) or [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md). Otherwise, select **Advanced**. |
    | **Storage accounts** | Azure Storage account. |
    | **Storage type** | Select the type based on the storage you want to mount. Azure Blobs only supports read-only access. |
    | **Storage container** or **Share name** | Files share or Blobs container to mount. |

    | **Mount path** | Directory inside the Linux container to mount to Azure Storage. Do not use `/` or `/home`.|
    ::: zone-end

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Use the [`az webapp config storage-account add`](/cli/azure/webapp/config/storage-account#az_webapp_config_storage_account_add) command. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config storage-account add --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --custom-id <custom-id> --storage-type AzureFiles --share-name <share-name> --account-name <storage-account-name> --access-key "<access-key>" --mount-path <mount-path-directory>
```

::: zone pivot="container-windows"
- `--storage-type` must be `AzureFiles` for Windows containers. 
- `mount-path-directory` must be in the form `/path/to/dir` or `[C-Z]:\path\to\dir`.
::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="container-linux"
- `--storage-type` can be `AzureBlob` or `AzureFiles`. `AzureBlob` is read-only.
- `--mount-path` is the directory inside the Linux container to mount to Azure Storage. Do not use `/` (the root directory).
::: zone-end

Verify your storage is mounted by running the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp config storage-account list --resource-group <resource-group> --name <app-name>
```

Verify your configuration by running the following command:

```azurecli
az webapp config storage-account list --resource-group <resource-group> --name <app-name>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Adding, editing, or deleting a storage mount causes the app to be restarted. 

::: zone pivot="container-linux"

## Test the mounted storage

To validate that the Azure Storage is mounted successfully for the app:

1. [Open an SSH session](configure-linux-open-ssh-session.md) into the container.
1. In the SSH terminal, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    df â€“h 
    ```
1. Check if the storage share is mounted. If it's not present, there's an issue with mounting the storage share.
1. Check latency or general reachability of the storage mount with the following command:

    ```bash
    tcpping Storageaccount.file.core.windows.net 
    ```

::: zone-end

## Best practices

- To avoid potential issues related to latency, place the app and the Azure Storage account in the same Azure region. Note, however, if the app and Azure Storage account are in same Azure region, and if you grant access from App Service IP addresses in the [Azure Storage firewall configuration](../storage/common/storage-network-security.md), then these IP restrictions are not honored.
::: zone pivot="container-linux"
- The mount directory in the custom container should be empty. Any content stored at this path is deleted when the Azure Storage is mounted (if you specify a directory under `/home`, for example). If you are migrating files for an existing app, make a backup of the app and its content before you begin.

- Mounting the storage to `/home` is not recommended because it may result in performance bottlenecks for the app. 
::: zone-end
- In the Azure Storage account, avoid [regenerating the access key](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage.md) that's used to mount the storage in the app. The storage account contains two different keys. Use a stepwise approach to ensure that the storage mount remains available to the app during key regeneration. For example, assuming that you used **key1** to configure storage mount in your app:

    1. Regenerate **key2**. 
    1. In the storage mount configuration, update the access the key to use the regenerated **key2**.
    1. Regenerate **key1**.

- If you delete an Azure Storage account, container, or share, remove the corresponding storage mount configuration in the app to avoid possible error scenarios. 

::: zone pivot="container-windows"
- The mounted Azure Storage account can be either Standard or Premium performance tier. Based on the app capacity and throughput requirements, choose the appropriate performance tier for the storage account. See [the scalability and performance targets for Files](../storage/files/storage-files-scale-targets.md)
::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="container-linux"
- The mounted Azure Storage account can be either Standard or Premium performance tier. Based on the app capacity and throughput requirements, choose the appropriate performance tier for the storage account. See the scalability and performance targets that correspond to the storage type:

    - [For Files](../storage/files/storage-files-scale-targets.md)
    - [For Blobs](../storage/blobs/scalability-targets.md)
::: zone-end

- If your app [scales to multiple instances](../azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-get-started.md), all the instances connect to the same mounted Azure Storage account. To avoid performance bottlenecks and throughput issues, choose the appropriate performance tier for the storage account.  

- It's not recommended to use storage mounts for local databases (such as SQLite) or for any other applications and components that rely on file handles and locks. 

::: zone pivot="container-windows"
- When using Azure Storage [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) with the app, you need to [enable the **Route All** setting](configure-vnet-integration-routing.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > In App Service environment V3, the **Route All** setting is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled.

- When using Azure Storage [private endpoints](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) with the app, you need to [enable the **Route All** setting](configure-vnet-integration-routing.md).
::: zone-end

- If you [initiate a storage failover](../storage/common/storage-initiate-account-failover.md) and the storage account is mounted to the app, the mount will fail to connect until you either restart the app or remove and add the Azure Storage mount.
