# How to create an NFS share
Azure file shares are fully managed file shares that live in the cloud. This article covers creating a file share that uses the NFS protocol.

## Applies to
| File share type | SMB | NFS |
|-|:-:|:-:|
| Standard file shares (GPv2), LRS/ZRS | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Standard file shares (GPv2), GRS/GZRS | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Premium file shares (FileStorage), LRS/ZRS | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) |

## Limitations
[!INCLUDE [files-nfs-limitations](../../../includes/files-nfs-limitations.md)]


### Regional availability
[!INCLUDE [files-nfs-regional-availability](../../../includes/files-nfs-regional-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites
- NFS shares only accept numeric UID/GID. To avoid your clients sending alphanumeric UID/GID, disable ID mapping.
- NFS shares can only be accessed from trusted networks. Connections to your NFS share must originate from one of the following sources:
    - Either [create a private endpoint](storage-files-networking-endpoints.md#create-a-private-endpoint) (recommended) or [restrict access to your public endpoint](storage-files-networking-endpoints.md#restrict-public-endpoint-access).
    - [Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN on Linux for use with Azure Files](storage-files-configure-p2s-vpn-linux.md).
    - [Configure a Site-to-Site VPN for use with Azure Files](storage-files-configure-s2s-vpn.md).
    - Configure [ExpressRoute](../../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).

- If you intend to use the Azure CLI, [install the latest version](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create a FileStorage storage account
Currently, NFS 4.1 shares are only available as premium file shares. To deploy a premium file share with NFS 4.1 protocol support, you must first create a FileStorage storage account. A storage account is a top-level object in Azure that represents a shared pool of storage which can be used to deploy multiple Azure file shares.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)
To create a FileStorage storage account, navigate to the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Storage Accounts** on the left menu.

    ![Azure portal main page select storage account.](media/storage-how-to-create-premium-fileshare/azure-portal-storage-accounts.png)

1. On the **Storage Accounts** window that appears, choose **Add**.
1. Select the subscription in which to create the storage account.
1. Select the resource group in which to create the storage account
1. Next, enter a name for your storage account. The name you choose must be unique across Azure. The name also must be between 3 and 24 characters in length, and can include numbers and lowercase letters only.
1. Select a location for your storage account, or use the default location.
1. For **Performance** select **Premium**.

    You must select **Premium** for **Fileshares** to be an available option in the **Account kind** dropdown.

1. For **Premium account type** choose **Fileshares**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/storage-how-to-create-file-share/files-create-smb-share-performance-premium.png" alt-text="Screenshot of premium performance selected.":::

1. Leave **Replication** set to its default value of **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**.
1. Select **Review + Create** to review your storage account settings and create the account.
1. Select **Create**.

Once your storage account resource has been created, navigate to it.

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)
To create a FileStorage storage account, open up a PowerShell prompt and execute the following commands, remembering to replace `<resource-group>` and `<storage-account>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

```powershell
$resourceGroupName = "<resource-group>"
$storageAccountName = "<storage-account>"
$location = "westus2"

$storageAccount = New-AzStorageAccount `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -Name $storageAccountName `
    -SkuName Premium_LRS `
    -Location $location `
    -Kind FileStorage
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
To create a FileStorage storage account, open up your terminal and execute the following commands, remembering to replace `<resource-group>` and `<storage-account>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

```azurecli-interactive
resourceGroup="<resource-group>"
storageAccount="<storage-account>"
location="westus2"

az storage account create \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --name $storageAccount \
    --location $location \
    --sku Premium_LRS \
    --kind FileStorage
```

## Disable secure transfer

You can't mount an NFS file share unless you disable secure transfer.

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Navigate to the storage account you created.
1. Select **Configuration**.
1. Select **Disabled** for **Secure transfer required**.
1. Select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/storage-files-how-to-mount-nfs-shares/disable-secure-transfer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of storage account configuration screen with secure transfer disabled." lightbox="media/storage-files-how-to-mount-nfs-shares/disable-secure-transfer.png":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Set-AzStorageAccount -Name "{StorageAccountName}" -ResourceGroupName "{ResourceGroupName}" -EnableHttpsTrafficOnly $False
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az storage account update -g {ResourceGroupName} -n {StorageAccountName} --https-only false
```

## Create an NFS share

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Now that you have created a FileStorage account and configured the networking, you can create an NFS file share. The process is similar to creating an SMB share, you select **NFS** instead of **SMB** when creating the share.

1. Navigate to your storage account and select **File shares**.
1. Select **+ File share** to create a new file share.
1. Name your file share, select a provisioned capacity.
1. For **Protocol** select **NFS**.
1. For **Root Squash** make a selection.

    - Root squash  - Access for the remote superuser (root) is mapped to UID (65534) and GID (65534).
    - No root squash (default) - Remote superuser (root) receives access as root.
    - All squash - All user access is mapped to UID (65534) and GID (65534).
    
1. Select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/storage-files-how-to-create-mount-nfs-shares/files-nfs-create-share.png" alt-text="Screenshot of file share creation blade.":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. To create a premium file share with the Azure PowerShell module, use the [New-AzRmStorageShare](/powershell/module/az.storage/new-azrmstorageshare) cmdlet.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Premium file shares are billed using a provisioned model. The provisioned size of the share is specified by `QuotaGiB` below. For more information, see [Understanding the provisioned model](understanding-billing.md#provisioned-model) and the [Azure Files pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/files/).

    ```powershell
    New-AzRmStorageShare `
        -StorageAccount $storageAccount `
        -Name myshare `
        -EnabledProtocol NFS `
        -RootSquash RootSquash `
        -QuotaGiB 1024
    ```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
To create a premium file share with the Azure CLI, use the [az storage share create](/cli/azure/storage/share-rm) command.

> [!NOTE]
> Premium file shares are billed using a provisioned model. The provisioned size of the share is specified by `quota` below. For more information, see [Understanding the provisioned model](understanding-billing.md#provisioned-model) and the [Azure Files pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/files/).

```azurecli-interactive
az storage share-rm create \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --storage-account $storageAccount \
    --name "myshare" \
    --enabled-protocol NFS \
    --root-squash RootSquash \
    --quota 1024
```

## Next steps
Now that you've created an NFS share, to use it you have to mount it on your Linux client. For details, see [How to mount an NFS share](storage-files-how-to-mount-nfs-shares.md).

If you experience any issues, see [Troubleshoot Azure NFS file shares](storage-troubleshooting-files-nfs.md).
