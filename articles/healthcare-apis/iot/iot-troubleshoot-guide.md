# Troubleshoot IoT connector

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Healthcare APIs is currently in PREVIEW. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability. 

This article provides guides and resources to troubleshoot IoT connector.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Having access to IoT connector Metrics is essential for monitoring and troubleshooting.  IoT connector assists you to do these actions through [Metrics](./how-to-display-metrics.md).

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [IoMT Connector Data Mapper](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir/tree/master/tools/data-mapper) tool for editing, testing, and troubleshooting IoT connector Device and FHIR destination mappings. Export mappings for uploading to IoT connector in the Azure portal or use with the [open-source version](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir) of IoT connector.

> [!NOTE]
> When opening an [Azure Technical Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) ticket for IoT connector, include [copies of your Device and FHIR destination mappings](./how-to-create-mappings-copies.md) to assist in the troubleshooting process.
