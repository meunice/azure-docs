# FHIR Rest API capabilities for Azure API for FHIR

In this article, we'll cover some of the nuances of the RESTful interactions of Azure API for FHIR.


## Conditional create/update

Azure API for FHIR supports create, conditional create, update, and conditional update as defined by the FHIR specification. One useful header in these scenarios is the [If-Match](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#concurrency) header. The `If-Match` header is used and will validate the version being updated before making the update. If the `ETag` doesn’t match the expected `ETag`, it will produce the error message *412 Precondition Failed*. 

## Delete and Conditional Delete

Azure API for FHIR offers two delete types. There is [Delete](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#delete), which is also know as Hard + Soft Delete, and [Conditional Delete](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#3.1.0.7.1).

### Delete (Hard + Soft Delete)

Delete defined by the FHIR specification requires that after deleting a resource, subsequent non-version specific reads of a resource returns a 410 HTTP status code. Therefore, the resource is no longer found through searching. Additionally, Azure API for FHIR enables you to fully delete (including all history) the resource. To fully delete the resource, you can pass a parameter settings `hardDelete` to true `(DELETE {{FHIR_URL}}/{resource}/{id}?hardDelete=true)`. If you don't pass this parameter or set `hardDelete` to false, the historic versions of the resource will still be available.

> [!NOTE]
> If you only want to delete the history, Azure API for FHIR supports a custom operation called `$purge-history`. This operation allows you to delete the history off of a resource.

### Conditional Delete

 Conditional Delete allows you to pass search criteria to delete a resource. By default, the Conditional Delete allows you to delete one item at a time. You can also specify the `_count` parameter to delete up to 100 items at a time. Below are some examples of using Conditional Delete.

To delete a single item using Conditional Delete, you must specify search criteria that returns a single item.

`DELETE https://{{FHIR_URL}}/Patient?identifier=1032704`

You can do the same search but include `hardDelete=true` to also delete all history.

`DELETE https://{{FHIR_URL}}/Patient?identifier=1032704&hardDelete=true`

To delete multiple resources, include `_count=100` parameter. This parameter will delete up to 100 resources that match the search criteria.

`DELETE https://{{FHIR_URL}}/Patient?identifier=1032704&_count=100`
 
### Recovery of deleted files

If you don't use the hard delete parameter, then the record(s) in Azure API for FHIR should still exist. The record(s) can be found by doing a history search on the resource and looking for the last version with data.
 
If the ID of the resource that was deleted is known, use the following URL pattern:

`<FHIR_URL>/<resource-type>/<resource-id>/_history`

For example: `https://myworkspace-myfhirserver.fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com/Patient/123456789/_history`
 
If the ID of the resource is not known, do a history search on the entire resource type:

`<FHIR_URL>/<resource-type>/_history`

For example: `https://myworkspace-myfhirserver.fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com/Patient/_history`

After you've found the record you want to restore, use the `PUT` operation to recreate the resource with the same ID, or use the `POST` operation to make a new resource with the same information.
 
> [!NOTE]
> There is no time-based expiration for history/soft delete data. The only way to remove history/soft deleted data is with a hard delete or the purge history operation.

## Patch and Conditional Patch

Patch is a valuable RESTful operation when you need to update only a portion of the FHIR resource. Using Patch allows you to specify the element(s) that you want to update in the resource without having to update the entire record. FHIR defines three types of ways to Patch resources in FHIR: JSON Patch, XML Patch, and FHIR Path Patch. Azure API for FHIR supports JSON Patch and Conditional JSON Patch (which allows you to Patch a resource based on a search criteria instead of an ID). To walk through some examples of using JSON Patch, refer to the sample [REST file](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/main/docs/rest/PatchRequests.http).

> [!NOTE]
> When using `PATCH` against STU3, and if you are requesting a History bundle, the patched resource's `Bundle.entry.request.method` is mapped to `PUT`. This is because STU3 doesn't contain a definition for the `PATCH` verb in the [HTTPVerb value set](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/valueset-http-verb.html).

### Testing Patch

Within Patch, there is a test operation that allows you to validate that a condition is true before doing the patch. For example, if you wanted to set a patient deceased, only if they were not already marked as deceased, you could use the example below: 

PATCH `http://{FHIR-SERVICE-NAME}/Patient/{PatientID}`
Content-type: `application/json-patch+json`

```
[
	{
		“op”: “test”,
		“path”: “/deceasedBoolean”,
		“value”: false
	},
	{
		“op”: “replace”
		“path”: “/deceasedBoolean”,
		“value”: true
	}
]

```

### Patch in Bundles

By default, JSON Patch is not supported in Bundle resources. This is because a Bundle only supports with FHIR resources and JSON Patch is not a FHIR resource. To work around this, we'll treat Binary resources with a content-type of `"application/json-patch+json"`as base64 encoding of JSON string when a Bundle is executed. For information about this workaround, log in to [Zulip](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Transaction.20with.20PATCH.20request). 

In the example below, we want to change the gender on the patient to female. We have taken the JSON patch `[{"op":"replace","path":"/gender","value":"female"}]` and encoded it to base64.

POST `https://{FHIR-SERVICE-NAME}/`
content-type: `application/json`

```
{
	“resourceType”: “Bundle”
	“id”: “bundle-batch”,
	“type”: “batch”
	“entry”: [
		{
			“fullUrl”: “Patient/{PatientID}”,
			“resource”: {
				“resourceType”: “Binary”,
				“contentType”: “application/json-patch+json”,
				“data”: "W3sib3AiOiJyZXBsYWNlIiwicGF0aCI6Ii9nZW5kZXIiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6ImZlbWFsZSJ9XQ=="
			},
			“request”: { 
				“method”: “PATCH”,
				“url”: “Patient/{PatientID}”
			}
		}
	]
}

```
