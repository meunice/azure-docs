# UI Library Overview

UI Library makes it easy for you to build modern communications user experiences using Azure Communication Services.  It gives you a library of production-ready UI components that you can drop into your applications:

::: zone pivot="platform-web"
[!INCLUDE [Web UI Library](includes/web-ui-library.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-mobile"
[!INCLUDE [Mobile UI Library](includes/mobile-ui-library.md)]
::: zone-end
