# User Facing Diagnostics

When working with calls in Azure Communication Services, problems may arise that cause issues for your customers. To help with this scenario, we have a feature called "User Facing Diagnostics" that you can use to examine various properties of a call to determine what the issue might be.

> [!NOTE] 
> User-facing diagnostics is currently supported only for our JavaScript / Web SDK.

## Accessing diagnostics

User-facing diagnostics is an extended feature of the core `Call` API and allows you to diagnose an active call.

```js
const userFacingDiagnostics = call.api(Features.UserFacingDiagnostics);
```

## Diagnostic values

The following user-facing diagnostics are available:

## User Facing Diagnostic events

- Subscribe to the `diagnosticChanged` event to monitor when any user-facing diagnostic changes.

```js
/**
 *  Each diagnostic has the following data:
 * - diagnostic is the type of diagnostic, e.g. NetworkSendQuality, DeviceSpeakWhileMuted, etc...
 * - value is DiagnosticQuality or DiagnosticFlag:
 *     - DiagnosticQuality = enum { Good = 1, Poor = 2, Bad = 3 }.
 *     - DiagnosticFlag = true | false.
 * - valueType = 'DiagnosticQuality' | 'DiagnosticFlag'
 */
const diagnosticChangedListener = (diagnosticInfo: NetworkDiagnosticChangedEventArgs | MediaDiagnosticChangedEventArgs) => {
    console.log(`Diagnostic changed: ` +
        `Diagnostic: ${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic}` +
        `Value: ${diagnosticInfo.value}` +
        `Value type: ${diagnosticInfo.valueType}`);

    if (diagnosticInfo.valueType === 'DiagnosticQuality') {
        if (diagnosticInfo.value === DiagnosticQuality.Bad) {
            console.error(`${diagnosticInfo.diagnostic} is bad quality`);

        } else if (diagnosticInfo.value === DiagnosticQuality.Poor) {

## Get the latest User Facing Diagnostics

- Get the latest diagnostic values that were raised. If a diagnostic is undefined, that is because it was never raised.

```js
const latestNetworkDiagnostics = userFacingDiagnostics.network.getLatest();

console.log(
  `noNetwork: ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.noNetwork.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.noNetwork.valueType}`
);

console.log(
  `networkReconnect: ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.networkReconnect.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.networkReconnect.valueType}`
);

console.log(
  `networkReceiveQuality: ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.networkReceiveQuality.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestNetworkDiagnostics.networkReceiveQuality.valueType}`
);

const latestMediaDiagnostics = userFacingDiagnostics.media.getLatest();

console.log(
  `speakingWhileMicrophoneIsMuted: ${latestMediaDiagnostics.speakingWhileMicrophoneIsMuted.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestMediaDiagnostics.speakingWhileMicrophoneIsMuted.valueType}`
);

console.log(
  `cameraStartFailed: ${latestMediaDiagnostics.cameraStartFailed.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestMediaDiagnostics.cameraStartFailed.valueType}`
);

console.log(
  `microphoneNotFunctioning: ${latestMediaDiagnostics.microphoneNotFunctioning.value}, ` +
    `value type = ${latestMediaDiagnostics.microphoneNotFunctioning.valueType}`
);
