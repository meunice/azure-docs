# Media quality statistics 
When working with calls in Azure Communication Services, there will be times that you need to know the media quality statistics that are being generated within an ACS call. To help understand these details, we have a feature called "Media quality statistics" that you can use to examine the low-level audio, video, and screen-sharing quality metrics.

### Media quality statistics for ongoing call
> **NOTE**
> This API is provided as a preview ('beta') for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.

Media quality statistics is an extended feature of the core `Call` API. You first need to obtain the MediaStats feature API object:

```js
const mediaStatsFeature = call.feature(Features.MediaStats);
```

Then, define `mediaStatsCollectorOptions` of type `MediaStatsCollectorOptions` if you want control over intervals. Otherwise SDK will use defaults.

```js
const mediaStatsCollectorOptions: SDK.MediaStatsCollectorOptions = {
    aggregationInterval: 2,
    dataPointsPerAggregation: 20
};
```

Where
- `aggregationInterval` is the interval in seconds that the statistics will be aggregated. 
- `dataPointsPerAggregation` defines how many data points are needed for each aggregation.

After getting media stats collector, you will receive `mediaStatsEmitted` event with stats every `aggregationInterval * dataPointsPerAggregation` seconds.

Example:
- If you set `aggregatinInterval` == 1
- `dataPointsPerAggregation` == 60

The media stats `mediaStatsEmmitted` will be raised every 60 seconds and will contain 60 unique units for each stat recorded.

- If you set `aggregatinInterval` == 60
- `dataPointsPerAggregation` == 1
The media stats `mediaStatsEmmitted` will be raised every 60 seconds and will contain 1 unique unit for each stat recorded.

As a developer you can invoke the `startCollector` method of `mediaStatsApi` with optional `mediaStatsSubscriptionOptions`.

```js
const mediaStatsCollector = mediaStatsFeature.startCollector(mediaStatsSubscriptionOptions);
```



```js
mediaStatsCollector.on('mediaStatsEmitted', (mediaStats) => {
    console.log('media stats:', mediaStats.stats);
    console.log('media stats collectionInterval:', mediaStats.collectionInterval);
    console.log('media stats aggregationInterval:', mediaStats.aggregationInterval);
});
```

To dispose media stats collector, invoke `dispose` method of `mediaStatsCollector`.

```js
mediaStatsCollector.dispose();
```

To dispose all collectors, invoke `disposeAllCollectors` method of `mediaStatsApi`.

```js
mediaStatsFeature.disposeAllCollectors();
```
## Best practices
If you want to collect this data for off-line inspection (after a call ends) it is recommended to collect this data and send it to your pipeline ingest after your call has ended. If you transmit this data during an current all you could use needed internet bandwidth that could be needed to help continue an ACS call (in cases when available bandwidth is low).
