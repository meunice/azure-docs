# Encrypt OS disks with a customer-managed key (CMK) on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) (preview)

By default, the OS disks of the virtual machines in an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster were encrypted with auto-generated keys managed by Microsoft Azure. For additional security, customers can encrypt the OS disks with self-managed keys when deploying an ARO cluster. This features allows for more control by encrypting confidential data with customer-managed keys.

Clusters created with customer-managed keys have a default storage class enabled with their keys. Therefore, both OS disks and data disks are encrypted by these keys. The customer-managed keys are stored in Azure Key Vault. For more information about using Azure Key Vault to create and maintain keys, see [Server-side encryption of Azure Disk Storage](../key-vault/general/basic-concepts.md) in the Microsoft Azure documentation.

With host-based encryption, the data stored on the VM host of your ARO agent nodes' VMs is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage service. This means the temp disks are encrypted at rest with platform-managed keys. The cache of OS and data disks is encrypted at rest with either platform-managed keys or customer-managed keys depending on the encryption type set on those disks. By default, when using ARO, OS and data disks are encrypted at rest with platform-managed keys, meaning that the caches for these disks are also by default encrypted at rest with platform-managed keys. You can specify your own managed keys following the encryption steps below. The cache for these disks will then also be encrypted using the key that you specify in this step.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ARO preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Preview features are provided "as is" and "as available," and they are excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. Preview features are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features are not meant for production use.

## Limitation
It is the responsibility of the customers to maintain the Key Vault and Disk Encryption Set in Azure. Failure to maintain the keys will result in broken ARO clusters. The VMs stop working and therefore the entire ARO cluster stops functioning. The Azure Red Hat OpenShift Engineering team cannot access the keys; therefore, they cannot back up, replicate, or retrieve the keys. For details about using Disk Encryption Sets to manage your encryption keys, see [Server-side encryption of Azure Disk Storage](../virtual-machines/disk-encryption.md) in the Microsoft Azure documentation.

## Prerequisites
* [Verify your permissions](tutorial-create-cluster.md#verify-your-permissions). You must have either Contributor and User Access Administrator permissions, or Owner permissions.
* Register the resource providers if you have multiple Azure subscriptions. For registration details, see [Register the resource providers](tutorial-create-cluster.md#register-the-resource-providers).

## Install the preview Azure CLI extension
Install and use the Azure CLI to create a Key Vault. The Azure CLI allows the execution of commands through a terminal using interactive command-line prompts or a script.

> [!NOTE]
> The CLI extension is required for the preview feature only.

1. Click the following URL to download both the Python wheel and the CLI extension:
    [https://aka.ms/az-aroext-latest.whl](https://aka.ms/az-aroext-latest.whl)
1. Run the following command:
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az extension add --upgrade -s <path to downloaded .whl file>
    ```
1. Verify that the CLI extension is being used:
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az extension list
    [
      {
        "experimental": false,
        "extensionType": "whl",
        "name": "aro",
        "path": "<path may differ depending on system>",
        "preview": true,
        "version": "1.0.1"
      }
    ]
    ```

## Create a virtual network containing two empty subnets
Create a virtual network containing two empty subnets. If you have an existing virtual network that meets your needs, you can skip this step. To review the procedure of creating a virtual network, see [Create a virtual network containing two empty subnets](tutorial-create-cluster.md#create-a-virtual-network-containing-two-empty-subnets).

## Create an Azure Key Vault instance
You must use an Azure Key Vault instance to store your keys. Create a new Key Vault with purge protection enabled. Then, create a new key within the Key Vault to store your own custom key.
1. Set additional environment permissions:
    ```
    export KEYVAULT_NAME=$USER-enckv
    export KEYVAULT_KEY_NAME=$USER-key
    export DISK_ENCRYPTION_SET_NAME=$USER-des
    ```
1. Create a Key Vault and a key in the Key Vault:
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az keyvault create -n $KEYVAULT_NAME \
                   -g $RESOURCEGROUP \
                   -l $LOCATION \
                   --enable-purge-protection true \
                   --enable-soft-delete true

    az keyvault key create --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME \
                           -n $KEYVAULT_KEY_NAME \
                           --protection software

    KEYVAULT_ID=$(az keyvault show --name $KEYVAULT_NAME --query "[id]" -o tsv)

    KEYVAULT_KEY_URL=$(az keyvault key show --vault-name $KEYVAULT_NAME \
                                            --name $KEYVAULT_KEY_NAME \
                                            --query "[key.kid]" -o tsv)
    ```

## Create an Azure Disk Encryption Set
The Azure Disk Encryption Set is used as the reference point for disks in ARO clusters. It is connected to the Azure Key Vault that you created in the previous step, and pulls the customer-managed keys from that location.
```azurecli-interactive
az disk-encryption-set create -n $DISK_ENCRYPTION_SET_NAME \
                              -l $LOCATION \
                              -g $RESOURCEGROUP \
                              --source-vault $KEYVAULT_ID \
                              --key-url $KEYVAULT_KEY_URL

DES_ID=$(az disk-encryption-set show -n $DISK_ENCRYPTION_SET_NAME -g $RESOURCEGROUP --query 'id' -o tsv)

DES_IDENTITY=$(az disk-encryption-set show -n $DISK_ENCRYPTION_SET_NAME \
                                           -g $RESOURCEGROUP \
                                           --query "[identity.principalId]" \
                                           -o tsv)
```

## Grant permissions for the Disk Encryption Set to access the Key Vault
Use the Disk Encryption Set that you created in the previous step, and grant permission for the Disk Encryption Set to access and use the Azure Key Vault.
```azurecli-interactive
az keyvault set-policy -n $KEYVAULT_NAME \
                       -g $RESOURCEGROUP \
                       --object-id $DES_IDENTITY \
                       --key-permissions wrapkey unwrapkey get
```

## Create an ARO cluster
Create an ARO cluster to use the customer-managed keys.
```azurecli-interactive
az aro create --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
              --name $CLUSTER  \
              --vnet aro-vnet  \
              --master-subnet master-subnet \
              --worker-subnet worker-subnet \
              --disk-encryption-set $DES_ID
```
After creating the ARO cluster, all VMs are encrypted with the customer-managed encryption keys.

To verify that you configured the keys correctly, run the following commands:
1. Get the name of the cluster Resource Group where the cluster VMs, disks, and so on are located:
    ```azurecli-interactive
    CLUSTERRESOURCEGROUP=$(az aro show --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP --name $CLUSTER --query 'clusterProfile.resourceGroupId' -o tsv | cut -d '/' -f 5)
    ```
2. Check that the disks have the correct Disk Encryption Set attached:
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az disk list -g $CLUSTERRESOURCEGROUP --query '[].encryption'
    ```
    The field `diskEncryptionSetId` in the output must point to the Disk Encryption Set that you specified while creating the ARO cluster.
