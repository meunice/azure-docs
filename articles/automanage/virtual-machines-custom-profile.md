# Create a custom profile in Azure Automanage for VMs

Azure Automanage for machine best practices has default best practice profiles that cannot be edited. However, if you need more flexibility, you can pick and choose the set of services and settings by creating a custom profile.

We support toggling services ON and OFF. We also currently support customizing settings on [Azure Backup](..\backup\backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare.md#create-a-custom-policy) and [Microsoft Antimalware](../security/fundamentals/antimalware.md#default-and-custom-antimalware-configuration).


## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/) before you begin.

> [!NOTE]
> Free trial accounts do not have access to the virtual machines used in this tutorial. Please upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following Azure RBAC permission is needed to enable Automanage for the first time on a subscription: **Owner** role, or **Contributor** along with **User Access Administrator** roles.


## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Disable Automanage for VMs

Quickly stop using Azure Automanage for virtual machines by disabling automanagement.

:::image type="content" source="media\virtual-machine-custom-profile\disable-step-1.png" alt-text="Disabling Automanage on a virtual machine.":::

1. Go to the **Automanage – Azure machine best practices** page that lists all of your auto-managed VMs.
1. Select the checkbox next to the virtual machine you want to disable.
1. Click on the **Disable automanagent** button.
1. Read carefully through the messaging in the resulting pop-up before agreeing to **Disable**.


## Clean up resources

If you created a new resource group to try Azure Automanage for virtual machines and no longer need it, you can delete the resource group. Deleting the group also deletes the VM and all of the resources in the resource group.

Azure Automanage creates default resource groups to store resources in. Check resource groups that have the naming convention "DefaultResourceGroupRegionName" and "AzureBackupRGRegionName" to clean up all resources.

1. Select the **Resource group**.
1. On the page for the resource group, select **Delete**.
1. When prompted, confirm the name of the resource group and then select **Delete**.
