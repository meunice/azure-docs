# Application Monitoring for Azure App Service and ASP.NET 

Enabling monitoring on your ASP.NET based web applications running on [Azure App Services](../../app-service/index.yml) is now easier than ever. Whereas previously you needed to manually instrument your app, the latest extension/agent is now built into the App Service image by default. This article will walk you through enabling Azure Monitor application Insights monitoring as well as provide preliminary guidance for automating the process for large-scale deployments.

> [!NOTE]
> Manually adding an Application Insights site extension via **Development Tools** > **Extensions** is deprecated. This method of extension installation was dependent on manual updates for each new version. The latest stable release of the extension is now  [preinstalled](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Site-Extensions) as part of the App Service image. The files are located in `d:\Program Files (x86)\SiteExtensions\ApplicationInsightsAgent` and are automatically updated with each stable release. If you follow the agent-based instructions to enable monitoring below, it will automatically remove the deprecated extension for you.

> [!NOTE]
> If both agent-based monitoring and manual SDK-based instrumentation is detected, only the manual instrumentation settings will be honored. This is to prevent duplicate data from being sent. To learn more about this, check out the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below.

## Enable agent-based monitoring

> [!NOTE]
> The combination of APPINSIGHTS_JAVASCRIPT_ENABLED and urlCompression is not supported. For more info see the explanation in the [troubleshooting section](#appinsights_javascript_enabled-and-urlcompression-is-not-supported).

1. **Select Application Insights** in the Azure control panel for your app service, then select **Enable**.

    :::image type="content"source="./media/azure-web-apps/enable.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Application Insights tab with enable selected."::: 

2. Choose to create a new resource, or select an existing Application Insights resource for this application. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you click **OK** to create the new resource you will be prompted to **Apply monitoring settings**. Selecting **Continue** will link your new Application Insights resource to your app service, doing so will also **trigger a restart of your app service**. 

     :::image type="content"source="./media/azure-web-apps/change-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Change your resource dropdown."::: 

3. After specifying which resource to use, you can choose how you want application insights to collect data per platform for your application. ASP.NET app monitoring is on-by-default with two different levels of collection.

    :::image type="content"source="./media/azure-web-apps-net/instrument-net.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Application Insights site extensions page with Create new resource selected."::: 
 
     Below is a summary of data collected for each route:
            
    | Data | ASP.NET Basic Collection | ASP.NET Recommended collection |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Adds CPU, memory, and I/O usage trends |Yes |Yes |
    | Collects usage trends, and enables correlation from availability results to transactions | Yes |Yes |
    | Collects exceptions unhandled by the host process | Yes |Yes |
    | Improves APM metrics accuracy under load, when sampling is used | Yes |Yes |
    | Correlates micro-services across request/dependency boundaries | No (single-instance APM capabilities only) |Yes |

4. To configure sampling, which you could previously control via the applicationinsights.config file you can now interact with it via Application settings with the corresponding prefix `MicrosoftAppInsights_AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor`. 

    - For example, to change the initial sampling percentage, you can create an Application setting of: `MicrosoftAppInsights_AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor_InitialSamplingPercentage` and a value of `100`.
    - To disable sampling, set `MicrosoftAppInsights_AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor_MinSamplingPercentage` to a value of `100`.
    - Supported settings include:
        - `MicrosoftAppInsights_AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor_InitialSamplingPercentage`
        - `MicrosoftAppInsights_AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor_MinSamplingPercentage`
        - `MicrosoftAppInsights_AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor_EvaluationInterval`
        - `MicrosoftAppInsights_AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor_MaxTelemetryItemsPerSecond`
        
    - For the list of supported adaptive sampling telemetry processor settings and definitions, you can consult the [code](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/blob/master/BASE/Test/ServerTelemetryChannel.Test/TelemetryChannel.Tests/AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessorTest.cs) and [sampling documentation](./sampling.md#configuring-adaptive-sampling-for-aspnet-applications).


## Enable client-side monitoring

Client-side monitoring is opt-in for ASP.NET. To enable client-side monitoring:

* **Settings** **>** **Configuration**
   * Under Application settings, create a **new application setting**:

     Name: `APPINSIGHTS_JAVASCRIPT_ENABLED`

     Value: `true`

   * **Save** the settings and **Restart** your app.

To disable client-side monitoring either remove the associated key value pair from the Application settings, or set the value to false.

## Automate monitoring

In order to enable telemetry collection with Application Insights, only the Application settings need to be set:

### Application settings definitions

|App setting name |  Definition | Value |
|-----------------|:------------|-------------:|
|ApplicationInsightsAgent_EXTENSION_VERSION | Main extension, which controls runtime monitoring. | `~2` |
|XDT_MicrosoftApplicationInsights_Mode |  In default mode, only essential features are enabled in order to insure optimal performance. | `default` or `recommended`. |
|InstrumentationEngine_EXTENSION_VERSION | Controls if the binary-rewrite engine `InstrumentationEngine` will be turned on. This setting has performance implications and impacts cold start/startup time. | `~1` |
|XDT_MicrosoftApplicationInsights_BaseExtensions | Controls if SQL & Azure table text will be captured along with the dependency calls. Performance warning: application cold start up time will be affected. This setting requires the `InstrumentationEngine`. | `~1` |

## Upgrade monitoring extension/agent - .NET 

### Upgrade from versions 2.8.9 and up

Upgrading from version 2.8.9 happens automatically, without any additional actions. The new monitoring bits are delivered in the background to the target app service, and on application restart they will be picked up.

To check which version of the extension you're running, go to `https://yoursitename.scm.azurewebsites.net/ApplicationInsights`.

:::image type="content"source="./media/azure-web-apps/extension-version.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the URL path to check the version of the extension you are running." border="false"::: 

### Upgrade from versions 1.0.0 - 2.6.5

Starting with version 2.8.9 the pre-installed site extension is used. If you are an earlier version, you can update via one of two ways:

* [Upgrade by enabling via the portal](#enable-agent-based-monitoring). (Even if you have the Application Insights extension for Azure App Service installed, the UI shows only **Enable** button. Behind the scenes, the old private site extension will be removed.)

* [Upgrade through PowerShell](#enable-through-powershell):

    1. Set the application settings to enable the pre-installed site extension ApplicationInsightsAgent. See [Enable through PowerShell](#enable-through-powershell).
    2. Manually remove the private site extension named Application Insights extension for Azure App Service.

If the upgrade is done from a version prior to 2.5.1, check that the ApplicationInsigths dlls are removed from the application bin folder [see troubleshooting steps](#troubleshooting).

## Troubleshooting

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a web app with the `ASP.NET` runtimes in Azure App Services it deploys a single static HTML page as a starter website. It is **not** recommended to troubleshoot an issue with default template. Deploy an application before troubleshooting an issue.

Below is our step-by-step troubleshooting guide for extension/agent based monitoring for ASP.NET based applications running on Azure App Services.

1. Check that `ApplicationInsightsAgent_EXTENSION_VERSION` app setting is set to a value of "~2".
2. Browse to `https://yoursitename.scm.azurewebsites.net/ApplicationInsights`.  

    :::image type="content"source="./media/azure-web-apps/app-insights-sdk-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the link above results page."border ="false"::: 
    
    - Confirm that the `Application Insights Extension Status` is `Pre-Installed Site Extension, version 2.8.x.xxxx, is running.` 
    
         If it is not running, follow the [enable Application Insights monitoring instructions](#enable-agent-based-monitoring).

    - Confirm that the status source exists and looks like: `Status source D:\home\LogFiles\ApplicationInsights\status\status_RD0003FF0317B6_4248_1.json`

         If a similar value is not present, it means the application is not currently running or is not supported. To ensure that the application is running, try manually visiting the application url/application endpoints, which will allow the runtime information to become available.

    - Confirm that `IKeyExists` is `true`
        If it is `false`, add `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` and `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` with your ikey guid to your application settings.

    - Confirm that there are no entries for `AppAlreadyInstrumented`, `AppContainsDiagnosticSourceAssembly`, and `AppContainsAspNetTelemetryCorrelationAssembly`.

         If any of these entries exist, remove the following packages from your application: `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights`, `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource`, and `Microsoft.AspNet.TelemetryCorrelation`.

#### Default website deployed with web apps does not support automatic client-side monitoring

When you create a web app with the `ASP.NET` runtimes in Azure App Services it deploys a single static HTML page as a starter website. The static webpage also loads a ASP.NET managed web part in IIS. This allows for testing codeless server-side monitoring, but does not support automatic client-side monitoring.

If you wish to test out codeless server and client-side monitoring for ASP.NET  in an Azure App Services web app we recommend following the official guides for [creating an ASP.NET Framework web app](../../app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore.md?tabs=netframework48) and then use the instructions in the current article to enable monitoring.


### APPINSIGHTS_JAVASCRIPT_ENABLED and urlCompression is not supported

If you use APPINSIGHTS_JAVASCRIPT_ENABLED=true in cases where content is encoded, you might get errors like:

- 500 URL rewrite error
- 500.53 URL rewrite module error with message Outbound rewrite rules cannot be applied when the content of the HTTP response is encoded ('gzip').

This is due to the APPINSIGHTS_JAVASCRIPT_ENABLED application setting being set to true and content-encoding being present at the same time. This scenario is not supported yet. The workaround is to remove APPINSIGHTS_JAVASCRIPT_ENABLED from your application settings. Unfortunately this means that if client/browser-side JavaScript instrumentation is still required, manual SDK references are needed for your webpages. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS#snippet-setup-ignore-if-using-npm-setup) for manual instrumentation with the JavaScript SDK.

For the latest information on the Application Insights agent/extension, check out the [release notes](https://github.com/MohanGsk/ApplicationInsights-Home/blob/master/app-insights-web-app-extensions-releasenotes.md).

[!INCLUDE [azure-web-apps-troubleshoot](../../../includes/azure-monitor-app-insights-azure-web-apps-troubleshoot.md)]

### PHP and WordPress are not supported

PHP and WordPress sites are not supported. There is currently no officially supported SDK/agent for server-side monitoring of these workloads. However, manually instrumenting client-side transactions on a PHP or WordPress site by adding the client-side JavaScript to your web pages can be accomplished by using the [JavaScript SDK](./javascript.md).

The table below provides a more detailed explanation of what these values mean, their underlying causes, and recommended fixes:

|Problem Value|Explanation|Fix
|---- |----|---|
| `AppAlreadyInstrumented:true` | This value indicates that the extension detected that some aspect of the SDK is already present in the Application, and will back-off. It can be due to a reference to `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource`,  `Microsoft.AspNet.TelemetryCorrelation`, or `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights`  | Remove the references. Some of these references are added by default from certain Visual Studio templates, and older versions of Visual Studio may add references to `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights`.
|`AppAlreadyInstrumented:true` | If the application is targeting ASP.NET Core 2.1 or 2.2, this value indicates that the extension detected that some aspect of the SDK is already present in the Application, and will back-off | Customers on .NET Core 2.1,2.2 are [recommended](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/287) to use Microsoft.AspNetCore.App meta-package instead. In addition, turn on "Interop with Application Insights SDK" in portal (see the instructions above).|
|`AppAlreadyInstrumented:true` | This value can also be caused by the presence of the above dlls in the app folder from a previous deployment. | Clean the app folder to ensure that these dlls are removed. Check both your local app's bin directory, and the wwwroot directory on the App Service. (To check the wwwroot directory of your App Service web app: Advanced Tools (Kudu) > Debug console > CMD > home\site\wwwroot).
|`AppContainsAspNetTelemetryCorrelationAssembly: true` | This value indicates that extension detected references to `Microsoft.AspNet.TelemetryCorrelation` in the application, and will back-off. | Remove the reference.
|`AppContainsDiagnosticSourceAssembly**:true`|This value indicates that extension detected references to `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource` in the application, and will back-off.| For ASP.NET remove the reference. 
|`IKeyExists:false`|This value indicates that the instrumentation key is not present in the AppSetting, `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`. Possible causes: The values may have been accidentally removed, forgot to set the values in automation script, etc. | Make sure the setting is present in the App Service application settings.
